1	2	2020-05-27T00:00:00Z	We have had the app for over a month now. We have had multiple issues with the app. The chat service is there but not able to resolve most issues . They have to be escalated and then may get a delayed response. We have had issues since the launch of our subscription that has still not been resolved. I would be prepared for issues if you have a more than a few subscribers.	1
1	5	2020-05-27T00:00:00Z	Great app with awesome support. Quick to answer my questions anytime I reach out. Lots of Customization options. Thanks Priyanka for helping make my store checkout user friendly.	2
1	5	2020-05-26T00:00:00Z	Great app, generally easy to use, lots of functionality. Excelent service (especially Aryan) that's right in the app, and quite responsive!	3
1	5	2020-05-26T00:00:00Z	I was having trouble installing it, then reached out to customer service. Carter helped me along with answering some of my questions regarding subscription. thank you so much!	4
1	5	2020-05-26T00:00:00Z	Great customer service. So easy to use, and analytics are fantastic.  Super simple to set up. I'd recommend it to anyone with a consumable product, and I will use it again... for sure.	5
1	5	2020-05-26T00:00:00Z	We are very thankful with Carter, our manager on bold suscriptions. Thank you very much for the service and attention.	6
1	5	2020-05-26T00:00:00Z	Fantastic app for our subscription service. Easy to use, with plenty of features and customisation options allowing our customers to modify their subscriptions each week. Stands out from the competitors due to top notch customer service, in particular from Sarah who answered all questions and queries, along with helping to migrate our business over to Bold. Highly recommended!	7
1	5	2020-05-21T00:00:00Z	Priyanka and Charles are the best. Great service. Quick results! I just downloaded the app and asked for help during the free trial. They were quick to help and delivered results!	8
1	3	2020-05-19T00:00:00Z	I give 5 stars the customer service, but overall the app is a band aid for subscription use.  Its a little confusing and we have had customers get double charged multiple times b/c there were rules that we didn't know about. Also they charge a fee per transaction on top of the credit card fees so it gets expensive.	9
1	5	2020-05-19T00:00:00Z	Naman was quick with the answers I needed. Super helpful with getting our Bold Subscriptions app set up.	10
2	4	2020-05-18T00:00:00Z	Have been working with the BOLD team to setup our subscriptions. Rebecca has been an awesome help! Thanks heaps BOLD.	11
2	5	2020-05-16T00:00:00Z	Spoke to Priyanka today about setting up a discount code. She was very helpful and answered all of my questions. She showed me some new products I can use to improve engagement as well.	12
2	5	2020-05-15T00:00:00Z	This App has lots of cool features and thanks to Simran in Support I had a great support experience once we managed to line up the timezones.	13
2	5	2020-05-15T00:00:00Z	Great app, easy to navigate and amend things when needed. Really helpful chat service - Priyanka was very helpful when chatting online	14
2	1	2020-05-14T00:00:00Z	It worked for a while, then many subscription orders started to go through without Bold, and it's been a mess. We cannot figure out why Bold works for some orders and doesn't for others.	15
2	5	2020-05-14T00:00:00Z	Naman helped a lot with our subscriptions and figuring everything out. Bold has a lot of great features and has helped us a lot!	16
2	4	2020-05-14T00:00:00Z	"The set up is a little tough, but the customer support is very helpful and can get everything set up exactly the way you want it.                                                 

5 Stars for Carter, the customer support guy was awesome!"	17
2	5	2020-05-13T00:00:00Z	I am far from a tech person but every time I have a problem figuring something out customer service is right there. Tonight Naman was amazing. Took seconds to figure out what I needed, walked me right through the steps and solved my problem. Thank you so much Naman	18
2	5	2020-05-13T00:00:00Z	I am only about a month into using the app which marks the start of new second payments hitting and Aryan has been SUPER helpful and patient with me to help me fully understand how things work!	19
2	5	2020-05-13T00:00:00Z	Bold's customer support is great! Naman sorted out all my questions quickly, and was exceedingly patient.	20
3	5	2020-05-13T00:00:00Z	Naman was so helpful! He walked me though everything and made the process so quick and easy! Thank you Naman!!	21
3	4	2020-05-12T00:00:00Z	"Carter was extremely helpful and very quick! 

The app itself is a little difficult to set up, although the tutorials are very helpful."	22
3	5	2020-05-12T00:00:00Z	Full disclosure, Bold Customer Service used to be basically non-existent. As of late, their representatives have been beyond excellent- you can tell they've really stepped it up. I had Simran this time around and he didn't disappoint! Thanks for the help!	23
3	5	2020-05-11T00:00:00Z	Carter was super helpful is clarifying some points with subscription app! amazing first two days using it.	24
3	5	2020-05-11T00:00:00Z	Great app. A few teething issues, but the team are super helpful. I had fantastic help from Carter and Simran who helped me customise the widget on the store. A few extra features would be great, like easy customisation of the checkout page and allowing mixed cart discounts. But I'm sure these will come.	25
3	5	2020-05-11T00:00:00Z	Excellent App if you can find some time to learn the functionality, team is very helpful, Rebecca & Carter helped us with all the questions we had. They even went beyond their responsibilities and helped us install some of the missing code. Thank you again.	26
3	5	2020-05-11T00:00:00Z	Bold is easy to use so far and very responsive customer service. Less confusing than other apps. Carter is super helpful!	27
3	5	2020-05-08T00:00:00Z	"Have been using the app for years and I love it, it's very user friendly. 

Customer service is top notch, Carter made sure to find the solution to my issue quickly and in a friendly manner."	28
3	5	2020-05-08T00:00:00Z	Very easy to use - Carter provided excellent customer service! Would love the ability to add a gift message that purchasers can update each month.	29
3	5	2020-05-07T00:00:00Z	Really awesome app. Integrates with a lot of different payment gateways and has allowed us to do some really innovative stuff we've been wanting to do for a long time now. Great support aswell!	30
4	4	2020-05-06T00:00:00Z	"Aryan was a HUGE help, and all the support there has been extremely patient and helpful- very impressive!

The app could be quite good, although a couple of shortcomings... filtering products (e.g. by collection, tags etc) within build-a-box product selection is custom code offered >$1,000 US. 

Also, not clear how the different subscription types might allow to differentiate wording (e.g. a subscription-only product shows 'subscription available' on product page... however, I don't want to remove from products where 'one time purchase' is available as well), I'd like to remove 'quantity' field where I need to... and other very minor inconveniences. 

However- BEWARE- do NOT let customers use Paypal, google pay buttons etc. when purchasing subscription...they MUST use 'proceed to checkout' or they will pay, the order will not show up in queue because it's through a different sales channel (Bold doesn't use the other three payment types). 

Very, VERY awkward to call back my very best customers (subscribers), and try to have them go back and resubscribe, using a different payment type- when they've ALREADY paid, so also must send them a discount code to offset their prior payment). It's a bloody MESS... probably something I did, but if that was cautioned somewhere it wasn't evident to a noob like me. 

Anyways- people are great, give it a try, and be very aware of this other issue. Cheers-
Michael

4	5	2020-05-06T00:00:00Z	Great customer service from Aryan Sharma! It has been a good experience during the design and development.	32
4	5	2020-05-06T00:00:00Z	Very prompt and helpful customer service, thank you for getting us up and running!! We really appreciate it! Everything seems to be working great.	33
4	5	2020-05-06T00:00:00Z	Carter provided excellent and prompt help via chat that fixed a big issue we were experiencing with our checkout.	34
4	5	2020-05-05T00:00:00Z	Massive ups to the crew at Bold Apps - we tried another competing app, and realised that this had much much much more functionality and wanted to swap over - they (particularly Sarah) was super helpful in the migration across to Bold Subscriptions (and we've since expanded into other Bold Apps on other stores) - and then even checked up a week after we'd migrated to ensure all was operating smoothly...seriously A+ customer service - whatever you're creatively looking to achieve with your store, they have a solution for it  - and a ready to help you get it!	35
4	5	2020-05-05T00:00:00Z	Carter is the best! He's very patient and super helpful when reviewing any questions I have about the app.	36
4	5	2020-05-05T00:00:00Z	Naman was a great help. Very kind and quickly fixed the issues I was having. I am pleased with the service and app.	37
4	5	2020-05-05T00:00:00Z	Carter was very helpful in troubleshooting product sync. The live chat function with their team is super comforting in case you ever have issues.	38
4	5	2020-05-04T00:00:00Z	Best app out there to sell subscription products and great support, Priyanka helped & fixed my issue very quickly	39
4	5	2020-05-04T00:00:00Z	I used this app to sell subscriptions and I do love the functionalities. The true star of the show however is the support, no doubt! Would recommend this app to anyone who wants to sell subscriptions on shopify :)	40
5	5	2020-05-04T00:00:00Z	Priyanka was an amazing help! Thank you so much. They were very patient with me and all my concerns.	41
5	1	2020-05-04T00:00:00Z	Pretty broken. They want to take a percentage of all sales. The support is god awful. And, the on-boarding process has been nothing short of a nightmare. Really, really bad. Stay away.	42
5	5	2020-05-06T00:00:00Z	Carter & Vighnesh was very helpful in helping me get the product set up. I was able to use the chat customer support to solve the issue.	43
5	5	2020-05-01T00:00:00Z	I started off using a competitor app and was unsuccessful for 3 days in setting up the subsctiption app to work (without naming it, it is highly rated on Shopify's app store). After getting zero response from support, I was then emailed an offer to pay for support for that app. Deleted the app and added this app instead. Within 1 hour of downloading the app, it was up and running. I even had an issue with the test order and Mayank in support live chatted me through the entire process. Support couldn't have been any better. Strongly recommended!	44
5	5	2020-05-13T00:00:00Z	Very amazing app! Thank you to Carter from customer support for listening to all issues and helping me figure out what was wrong. Highly recommend this app and thank you again Carter.	45
5	5	2020-05-01T00:00:00Z	The customer support here is outstanding, spoke with Mayank today. Amazing person to talk too. He addressed my all concerns by giving me immediate solution to it. In the past spoke to Harpreet & Laurel, both of them were very friendly with prompt solutions. In entirety everyone is awesome and helpful in this company. Thank you Bold Support!	46
5	5	2020-05-01T00:00:00Z	Fantastic app and support, Naman was great at helping me when I stumbled into a problem, friendly and quick support! The app itself is easy to set up and manage and integrated well with our custom theme.	47
5	5	2020-05-01T00:00:00Z	Carter, Samantha, and Melody were all great helping me with various questions today. Fast, smart, friendly and helpful live chat. Thank you.	48
5	5	2020-05-01T00:00:00Z	The customer support here is outstanding, spoke with Daniel today and he was awesome. The apps are brilliant and the live chat is amazing top rated app for sure!!!! Start using them immediately 5*	49
5	5	2020-05-01T00:00:00Z	Carter, on the bold help team is great. Thank you carter for all the help! Appreciate the speedy responses.	50
6	5	2020-04-30T00:00:00Z	Kelsey in Customer Service was a pleasure to work with! She was friendly and efficient and helped us solve a concern easily! Thank you!	51
6	5	2020-04-30T00:00:00Z	Priyanka is great!  The customer service has been great.  Very quick to respond and very helpful.   Thank you for your help!	52
6	5	2020-05-04T00:00:00Z	Both Carter and Priyanka have helped me navigate the site and easily solved my problems when I had technical questions. Really great and efficient customer service.	53
6	5	2020-04-30T00:00:00Z	Aryan S. was extremely helpful. Customer Service is perfect and the app is sweet. I recommend this one.	54
6	5	2020-04-29T00:00:00Z	Naman was great, clear and quick! Solved my problem in under 10 mins! Great service! Thanks again Naman!	55
6	5	2020-04-29T00:00:00Z	Melody and Rebecca did an amazing job with helping me get my store all squared away! I recommend them to any advanced or beginner shopify user! I am impressed, great work you guys! :)	56
6	5	2020-04-28T00:00:00Z	Carter was super helpful when I was unsure of which type to use.  The whole Bold team has been great when I needed help!  Thank you	57
6	5	2020-04-27T00:00:00Z	Naman was super helpful and friendly! My problem with the bold recurring orders app was solved quickly.	58
6	5	2020-04-27T00:00:00Z	I used Bold to launch a subscription based product and was very pleased with the apps performance and ease of use. Most impressively the customer service team has gone above and beyond to answer questions every single time I have them, Carter has followed up and been a great resource of support!	59
6	5	2020-04-27T00:00:00Z	"I use BOLD app for my clients all the time since they have everything the clients want to use and I use them because of not only the features but also their customer support. Their support is just so helpful and FAST. Especially, a support agent, Naman, resolved our issue quickly and very helpful.
Thank you, Bold :) You guys are awesome!"	60
7	5	2020-04-26T00:00:00Z	I spent a lot of time researching which app was best for our specific purpose and this one was one of the best!  Customer support was always helpful and got back to me right away.  My hats off to you and your team : )	61
7	5	2020-04-25T00:00:00Z	"Have used bold for a couple of years now and really rate the support. They get things sorted quickly. (Thank you to Daniel for sorting some custom coding for me QUICK SNAP!) 

Haven't had any issues at all and the process to switch was easy, to maintain even easier and i am super happy with them."	62
7	5	2020-04-24T00:00:00Z	We have completed setup and everything works well.  We are happy with the backend setup tools.  Samantha helped us out twice to get things rolling.  We are actually renting a physical product versus a typical subscription model, so we had to tweak a few things to make this customer friendly.  So far, so good!	63
7	5	2020-04-24T00:00:00Z	This app does everything you need. Great customer service, Naman and Cody were quick to reply and help with an issue I was unable to solve on my own. I highly recommend Bold to anyone looking for a subscription plugin to their Shopify store.	64
7	5	2020-05-19T00:00:00Z	Great app with good functionality. Sarah and Carter with Bold answered every question and problem I had perfectly and in good time. Sarah even notified me about and helped me fix problems that I didn't realize I had. Above and beyond EXCELLENT customer service! Thanks Sarah and Carter!	65
7	5	2020-04-24T00:00:00Z	Customer service is terrific. They are available by email or inmediatly via chat. They always answer all my questions effectively. Thank you.	66
7	5	2020-04-24T00:00:00Z	Some of the best support I've experienced in dealing with Shopify apps. Priyanka was outstanding in helping me with installation and theme-specific questions.	67
7	5	2020-04-23T00:00:00Z	Loving the Bold subscription app and have found the speed and accuracy of the help from Vighnesh  a fantastic additional value.	68
7	5	2020-04-22T00:00:00Z	Great app and great Customer service! Cody was knowledgable and helped me with everything I needed! I used this app for my meal prep company and it works like a charm! So far so good! My customers and I love how we can create our own subscriptions. Really separates ourselves from the competition	69
7	5	2020-04-22T00:00:00Z	Aryan was great. Helped me without a delay. Look forward to installing yet ANOTHER bold up. Great products all around.	70
8	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	"Aryan was fantastic, but all the help I've had with bold has been terrific.
Thanks for the great customer service both by phone and chat."	71
8	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	"Aryan Sharma was very helpful!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks Again 
Answered all of my questions about notifications

Jack"	72
8	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	Excellent customer support. Carter was very helpful in getting me set up with my subscription service. I will definitely be using Bold moving forward!	73
8	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	Great subscription app with even better customer service! Service is always fast and friendly, we definitely recommend giving them a try!	74
8	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	Really solid product and awesome support. Helpful in creating subscriptions on the Shopify platform. Naman was super helpful. Thanks Bold Commerce :)	75
8	5	2020-04-20T00:00:00Z	Every time I mess up they always manage to fix it for me! Abhi has been brilliant in fixing my latest problem! Great customer service! Thank you Abhi!!	76
8	5	2020-04-20T00:00:00Z	Brilliant customer review. So helpful and will go the extra ten miles, let alone one. The chat crew are great. Special shoutout to Daniel!	77
8	5	2020-04-19T00:00:00Z	Great for a subscription business and excellent customer service (thank you, Ankur!) I do not recommend an automatic installation (which didn't work properly), but Ankur and his team were prompt and professional in fixing all the bugs.	78
8	5	2020-04-18T00:00:00Z	We were having an issue within our customer interface. After a few minutes on a chat with Aryan Sharma, we had a work around until the website was corrected.  Thanks so much!	79
8	5	2020-04-17T00:00:00Z	I was having issues, but once I started a live chat, an installation error was identified, and I got some super great help from Aryan to move to resolve it.	80
9	5	2020-04-17T00:00:00Z	Customer service has been great and Bold has done a great job with the subscription app. It works well and does exactly what we need.	81
9	5	2020-04-16T00:00:00Z	I subscribed to Bold because it was highly regarded, and I needed to immediately implement a subscription app. I was so pleased, when Snigdha informed me today that the install was complete, fast and quick, and on checking, it is performing perfectly. Very professional, and that is what online businesses should be about. Thanks Snigdha.	82
9	5	2020-04-16T00:00:00Z	This app is very intuitive and easy to use. When I ran into a problem an awesome support staff member named Prianka was able to help me out in a matter of a few minutes.	83
9	5	2020-04-16T00:00:00Z	Great support from Abhi. The app has a lot of useful tools and functionalities. The integration is really easy but if you have any issue you have free support to instal it. Thanks	84
9	5	2020-04-16T00:00:00Z	Very good application, complete and easy to use. Extremely responsive customer support, thanks to Vighnesh for his help!	85
9	5	2020-04-15T00:00:00Z	Cody was very helpful. Resolved my issue very quickly. Great communication and the app so far is great.	86
9	5	2020-04-15T00:00:00Z	"Does what it should. I will say that setup is a bit tedious. I'm not a developer, but i have some coding skill and was able to set it up relatively easy. However, for most people with no technical background, you'll likely need support. That said, their support team was great.

After I got everything installed, I was having issues adjusting font sizes, colors, etc. because my store settings were overriding the app settings. I got on live chat and spoke with Mayank who was very helpful in troubleshooting. I'd recommend this app and the people behind it."	87
9	5	2020-04-15T00:00:00Z	Daniel is mah boi!!! But really. In the middle of the covid I've had a number of developers be slow and unhelpful. Not Bold! They are quick and knowledgeable! Very concise and friendly. Thanks!	88
9	5	2020-04-15T00:00:00Z	I had a slew of questions regarding initial setup and Vighnesh did an awesome job working with me and showed great patience by answering each question one by one. In deciding between this and another subscription platform, this will be a major factor in the decision.	89
9	1	2020-04-15T00:00:00Z	"I'll start with what doesn't work.

1. Although Stripe is listed as a payment gateway option, it does not work for Stripe Mexico. After contacting Bold support, the answer was: We can't do anything, fix it with Stripe.

2. They have announced that it is possible to integrate the Zapiet app. But they don't mention that it doesn't work for the meal box model. They also have no other option to manage local deliveries. After contacting the support, the answer was: We cannot solve it, you should see it with Zapiet.

3. I needed a report with all the options selected by the clients in their meal boxes. Well, when contacting support they told me that something like this didn't exist. However, after searching a little more, I found the report by myself.

4. Recurring subscription charging does not work at all. For it to work it is necessary to deactivate the CVC / CVV request in my payment gateway. But my payment gateway requires that this JSON request be made from Bold in a specific way. After contacting the support, guess what the answer was: We can't do anything, you should see it with your provider.

In short, I can't receive payments and I can't plan deliveries either.

It works? Well, at first it looks functional, but it's not."	90
10	5	2020-04-14T00:00:00Z	Raphael and the team were extremely helpful and went the extra mile to get Bold subscriptions up and running across a couple of my sites... can't recommend enough, great work guys! Thanks	91
10	5	2020-04-14T00:00:00Z	Priyanka rocks! Good app, better than the others in terms of comprehensive customizations. Shipping dates, etc... need to be a little creative for multiple ship days, etc.. but it's all possible. Bold gets the job done.	92
10	5	2020-04-14T00:00:00Z	i have been given excellent onboarding service. Abhishek answered all of my questions, and was very patient as I walked through each step. he made sure i understood what was going on at each step. The client service was prompt and very helpful!	93
10	5	2020-04-14T00:00:00Z	Great and responsive customer service. Been using this app for a while now and have only had a few hiccups that were fixed quickly.	94
10	5	2020-04-14T00:00:00Z	Thanking Daniel and his team for their quick and helpful response!  Bold Subscription responded back promptly.	95
10	5	2020-04-14T00:00:00Z	Ankur & Priyanka thank you for all your help today resolving an issue I had with Bold Subscription. I appreciate all your help getting that refund to me and providing a telephone number to call in the future when needed.	96
10	5	2020-04-16T00:00:00Z	Priyanka assisted me with finding language settings to clarify the buying experience for our customers. She was very helpful! Thank you Priyanka! Additional help from Clifford today provided a step by step solution to additional questions - saving me the need to contact BOLD. Great CHAT support from both agents.	97
10	5	2020-04-13T00:00:00Z	Their live chat is super helpful. They respond quickly and have handled all our concerns. Carter in particular was very helpful and patient.	98
10	5	2020-04-13T00:00:00Z	Good customer service. Always responsive and so far so good. The dashboard is also intuitive and not too difficult to use.	99
10	5	2020-04-11T00:00:00Z	Carter quickly and efficiently walked me through some very basic steps that I was struggling with.	100
11	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	So far has worked well for my digital goods subscriptions. Aryan Sharma in customer service was great -- friendly and resolved my issue quickly.	101
11	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	I had a few questions and Vighnesh was able to solve them quickly. Very professional, accurate and knowledgeable.	102
11	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	Great customer service. Carter and Kelsey took care of our issue promptly. Great app, the additional recurring revenue created is well worth the monthly fee.	103
11	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	"Excellent Customer Service!  Aryan was very professional & quick to respond.  
I would recommend this app. Thank You!"	104
11	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	Very helpful bunch of folks who try their best to make you happy. Happy with app and happy with service. Highly recommend. Aloha!	105
11	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	Have not yet fully launched this app in our store but the customer service has been impeccable. Worked with Carter and Regina and they answer every last question with patience and detail. Excited to continue working with this company.	106
11	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	Excellent support from the tech team, really good app and interface. Spoke with the team todayand they were able to help and fix my problem in no time 10/10	107
11	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	The supportteam at Bold - Regina was perfect.... Really nice and super quick. They will fix my problem.	108
11	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	Carter helped me figure out where a customer can change their payment info and Regina helped get me back to Carter when my chat disappeared. Thanks!	109
11	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	its my time meeting the help team, aryan was instantly helpful, literally read my mind and solved my problem with ease, great communication, really appreciate the help. I wish all online assists were as useful.	110
12	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	Aryan Sharma was a huge help and sent me on the right path to the migration team. looking forward to using this app	111
12	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	Amazing live chat experience with Aryan Sharma. The help was amazing and all of my problems were solved. Thanks!	112
12	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	Just started using this app a few months ago. Customer service is quick. I spoke with Carter and he was helpful, friendly and he was able to point me in the right direction efficiently. I highly recommend this app. It's versatile and can be used in many ways for your business.	113
12	5	2020-04-07T00:00:00Z	Loving the app so far. Will need to refresh and check back once the app gets up and running further. I had a few questions and Vighnesh was extremely helpful. I was a little surprised that Bold was quite a bit more expensive than other subscription apps but after researching, they seem to be quite worth the extra cost. And they came with 2 months free trial so that was an easy call.	114
12	5	2020-04-07T00:00:00Z	I had an issue with understanding the process of connecting the “BOLD SUBSCRIPTION” app to my store. I thought I was going to pull my hair out. I called the help line and talked to Mayank. He voice was calm. He had so much patience with me with walking me through the necessary steps to setting up my store correctly. Thank you for helping me get through this trying time. Mayank “YOU ROCK” :-)	115
12	5	2020-04-07T00:00:00Z	Really good app with great customer service. There was an issue with my site which was fixed by Brenda within 24 hours.	116
12	5	2020-04-06T00:00:00Z	Laurel, customer service lady extraordinaire, was super duper helpful. Fast, efficient, amazing. Loving Bold. Bold rules.	117
12	5	2020-04-06T00:00:00Z	I had trouble getting it setup, but it turned out to be a simple issue with my browser cache. Fast, spot on customer service by Aryan Sharma. Thank you!	118
12	5	2020-04-06T00:00:00Z	I ran into a tiny glitch adding product on my site.  Vighnesh in customer support had it fixed in a flash.  Great customer service makes all the difference! Thank you.	119
12	5	2020-04-06T00:00:00Z	"I used this app for ""Monthly Subscription"" discount. It helps me to manage pricing. I have good experience with Customer support as well. Specially with ""Naman""."	120
13	5	2020-04-04T00:00:00Z	This app has tons of features, it's easy to use, and it has quick, helpful support behind it. Priyanka was able to help me figure out my issue in a timely manner and with a great attitude. I love the app and recommend it to anyone else thinking of using subscriptions on their site!	121
13	4	2020-05-04T00:00:00Z	"The app is very straight forward, but our theme had some troubles adapting and installing. Good thing they have awesome support! Naman helped me get connected with the right department to fix the issue and also answered the many questions I had. Keep it up folks.

Update: The app has its shortcomings, but I still think it's the only decent build-a-box app for shopify. Their support team is still amazing. Chatting with me well after hours to make sure I don't leave the chat with some sort of answer to my questions. I really appreciated it. Shoutout to Priyanka for that."	122
13	5	2020-04-02T00:00:00Z	"Top-class customer service, fully recommended, they tailor-coded what my theme needed, thank you Bold. 
And special thanks to Rebecca G!"	123
13	5	2020-04-02T00:00:00Z	Naman help a lot thank you a lot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	124
13	5	2020-04-01T00:00:00Z	Naman was a great help setting up the app and my store for subscriptions, both being knowledgable and patient. Thank you!	125
13	5	2020-04-01T00:00:00Z	Great customer service - Priyanka had the answer for me right off the bat - no wait. Very exceptional service. Top marks. Thanks again!	126
13	5	2020-04-02T00:00:00Z	Alexa saved the day. Very helpful. Solved all of our issues. Give her a raise!!! App is working now!	127
13	4	2020-03-31T00:00:00Z	A little expensive but may be worth the extra cost. The customer support is excellent. I deleted my subscriptions app by mistake and they had me back online in 10 minutes! Aryan was super helpful.	128
13	5	2020-03-31T00:00:00Z	Regina has been an absolute blessing to work with. I was on the verge of canceling Bold Subscriptions due to hearing other services that are user friendly however Regina did her best in providing the best service I could ask for. For what I asked, I know it wasn't within her responsibilities to do however, I needed support and she made sure I received it to launch my subscription service. I will be a customer of Bold products as long as individuals like Regina are part of the team. Thank you for everything!!!!!	129
13	5	2020-03-31T00:00:00Z	This app has a lot of functions. We were struggling with getting customers to opt in for subscription. Aryan was kind to extend our trial a little longer so we can try another strategy with subscription products. Thanks!	130
14	5	2020-04-06T00:00:00Z	Ankur & Harpreet kaur are absolute wizards! They helped me work out a few kinks on my store. Customers are happy and that makes me happy. Thanks Ankur & Harpreet!!	131
14	5	2020-03-30T00:00:00Z	Great App! I love the Support that comes with it! I have a feeling it's because they're Canadian (which I appreciate because I am too ;)). Thank Priyanka for your help today. You were patient, polite and awesome.	132
14	5	2020-03-30T00:00:00Z	I haven't launched my new subscription service yet, so I can't speak to that end, but I GREATLY appreciate the support staff and installers for their assistance in helping me install this app. As far as the app itself goes, it seems really user friendly which I'm excited about. Looking forward to continuing to use another awesome BOLD app! Thanks Priyanka & Snigdha for your quick assistance!	133
14	5	2020-03-27T00:00:00Z	"Shout out to Daniel for helping me add a product to ""Build your own Subscription'. Super helpful and speedy with fixing my issue. Thanks BOLD."	134
14	5	2020-03-26T00:00:00Z	Aryan was awesome and helped me tremendously -- can't recommend enough. 10/10 customer service! A+ service!	135
14	5	2020-03-25T00:00:00Z	Yes, i recommend this app. Thank you for your help, you were very helpful. Aryan Sharma! You were awesome! have a great day =)	136
14	5	2020-03-31T00:00:00Z	Great app and amazing support team. Priyanka AND Dylan were both VERY understanding, patient, and attentive in helping me with the front end styling and customer experience. What more could you ask for?	137
14	5	2020-03-24T00:00:00Z	Awesome customer service I receive today. They are patient and help walk me through setting up payments and connecting it to my shopify store.	138
14	5	2020-03-24T00:00:00Z	Very good customer service. Is difficult to mention all of them but I remember I received great help from Simranjit, Samuel , Chintan	139
14	5	2020-03-24T00:00:00Z	It's the staff that make this app so great! Everytime. Stunning customer service from Priyanka today . No problem too great, or small - entirely patient with our general tech-incompetence.	140
15	5	2020-03-23T00:00:00Z	We are still in the trial period of testing and experimenting with the app on our web site. At the same time, we need to share our 5-star experience from the app, but also from the people behind it. Million thanks to Aryan Sharma, who has been so supportive that one can rarely enjoy such an open partnership. He addressed our request with patience, understanding and did all the things possible to accommodate our needs and support our business. Million thanks to you, Aryan and Bold team!	141
15	5	2020-03-19T00:00:00Z	This app has been huge for our small business and allowing us to offer a subscription to our customers.  And whenever I need help, I just hop on the chat and I am taken care of.  Naman helped me just today and was so awesome!!	142
15	5	2020-03-19T00:00:00Z	"I'm not the most tech savvy person out there but I could figure it out. And when I have questions, I can jump in a live chat within the app (I'm on Shopify) and not have to leave. So they can walk me through what I need to do without me trying to remember the steps or wait for the transcript to send to my email. 
I've been with Bold for more than a year but what finally prompted this review is my most recent interaction with Carter. Coronavirus is here and starting to hit this small business - he was incredibly helpful, sensitive to our needs and went above and beyond what he needed to do. Huge thanks to the Bold team. and I know there are a couple of subscription apps out there but I definitely made the right choice."	143
15	5	2020-03-16T00:00:00Z	This app is the lifeblood of our company.  Priyanka was just immensely helpful at a critical time for our company's growth.  Andriy, Victoria, Zach, and others have also gone to bat for us and helped us tremendously.  We wouldn't be where we are without this app and this team of people.  We're incredibly thankful for all of your great work and for your wonderful customer service.  Please keep it up!!  Take care and stay safe!	144
15	5	2020-03-16T00:00:00Z	Great support by BOLD team. All subscription options are available with bOLD. Mayank & Naman provided me guidance for my complete integration. We are still working on some points but i m sure they will close it soon. Thanks Mayank, Naman & BOLD team	145
15	2	2020-03-16T00:00:00Z	The app functions well as far as subscriptions but they have made it a nightmare to track Analytics correctly, Analytics tracking has the wrong reporting for total sales, the way they report creates incorrect data for Google ads making it a nightmare to run scusecfull ads. They also make it a nightmare to use tracking code for ShareASale and always just recommend that one starts using Refervission and do not care that we have a real affiliate program via ShareASale.  Their answer for everything that doesn't report well is basically sorry but we recommend you spend thousands and request customization.	146
15	5	2020-03-13T00:00:00Z	Vighnesh and Harprett were first class at helping me get to a solution. Thank you! Not quite solved yet but I have faith!	147
15	5	2020-04-06T00:00:00Z	"The support for Bold is absolutely great. during a short chat Priyanka logged in on her side and sorted out our issues in no time. Highly recommend Bold. 
The online chat is amazing.  Update: again the support team was excellent one more time, with Samantha helping out in a very professional way and short time."	148
15	5	2020-03-12T00:00:00Z	Great app for increasing LTV. Naman was also really helpful with a couple of issues we were having. Thanks again!	149
15	5	2020-03-11T00:00:00Z	This app is quite helpful/easy to use and the support team is very friendly and supportive. Especially, Simran helped me a lot. His support is really kind, knowledgible and very customer oriented. Thank you!	150
16	5	2020-03-11T00:00:00Z	"Great customer service. Troubleshoot any issues easily.
Responsive and figured the problem out right away!"	151
16	5	2020-03-11T00:00:00Z	A fantastic app that has helped our business grow from strength to strength! Customer service has been swift and friendly. Many thanks to Carter for speedily resolving our queries via online chat, a big thumbs up from us!	152
16	5	2020-03-10T00:00:00Z	We use multiple Bold Apps to help keep our store running in tip-top shape to compete with the major companies. Bold Apps allow us to compete on a high level while offering services like reoccurring orders that the customer craves. Today I reached out to support because of an issue with a customer order and Naman not only found the root of the problem but help me learn what was going wrong on our end. Bold Subscription is a must-have app for any store with reoccurring products like our plant-based cruelty-free skincare.	153
16	5	2020-03-10T00:00:00Z	Carter was super helpful, quick and nice. He also educated me that a password protected site may create bugs! It was great to learn that since now it will save me time in the future.	154
16	5	2020-03-10T00:00:00Z	This is a snow storm day today.   A customer contact me with a strange story about his subscription.  I tried to understand what's happening, a skipped some month and it looks like it is a prepaid or maybe a 3 fixed month.  Hard to know, I contacted the support, got Naman on the case.  Naman help me to understand what happened with it very quickly and I got back to my customer.  When credit card and pre-autorised payment are in, customer are always sensitive.  This is serious.  I'm using Bold subscription since many years and I got this kind of support many, many times.  It is important for me to get this kind of service.  And today, I'm looking at the windows, and through the snow storm, alone at my desk, I know I'm not alone.  :-)	155
16	5	2020-03-09T00:00:00Z	The app is very capable and works well for our purposes. But, the best thing about BOLD is the tech support.  It's always a pleasure (and educational). Simran and Chintan rock!	156
16	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	Carter was very helpful! Appreciate the speed and efficiency. We really like bold and continue to use it on our sites.	157
16	5	2020-03-07T00:00:00Z	Got some fast and thoughtful help from Mayank and Vignesh.  Guys are great.	158
16	5	2020-03-07T00:00:00Z	Great app, great customer suppor, loaaaaats of possibilities and they're not to expensive. Great package	159
16	5	2020-03-06T00:00:00Z	Clifford, Alysha, Paul and Naman helped me get this app installed and running in my dev store quickly. I am happy with this app's features and support from Bold subscription team!	160
17	5	2020-03-06T00:00:00Z	Sukh, Clifford & Taylor were a great help to me getting this app installed. Thanks for the great customer service!	161
17	5	2020-03-05T00:00:00Z	Great customer service I started my trial and never got a chance to use it and Kelsey extended my trial as soon as I reached out!	162
17	5	2020-03-04T00:00:00Z	Aryan Sharma is very patient & helpful! Top Lad. He has been working with me for the past 40 minutes	163
17	5	2020-03-03T00:00:00Z	Great and very considerate customer service! Shoutout to Scott! Great service and very useful app!!!	164
17	5	2020-03-02T00:00:00Z	carter rocks! He helped me through a ton of details and was not in the least bit annoyed. He was there till the end!	165
17	5	2020-03-02T00:00:00Z	The app has worked really well and customer service HAS ALWAYS been available to help. Had a cashe issue with recurring orders and Sukh helped to eliminate the problem. Thanks	166
17	4	2020-02-28T00:00:00Z	We have not officially launched the subscription application yet but it has great functionality that we have witnessed in our testing.  The support has been great in getting us set up.  I would have given this a five star review, however, we were hoping to use this application in tandem with Bold's wholesale and tiered pricing application but at this time they do not work together.   We are looking forward to going live and getting feedback from our customers.	167
17	1	2020-03-03T00:00:00Z	This app constantly locks if you are not the account holder making it impossible to manage the setting and configurations if not the account owner of the shopify business.  This is terrible if you're a business that uses other people that manage the app. I've been talking back and forth with tech support, first they said it was a shopify issue, they can't unlock it, and they can't figure out their apps issue.	168
17	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	Appreciate their support team so much! They always have answers to my questions, and help me in my time of need. Aryan was very accommodating to help my store out during the COVID-19 pandemic.	169
17	5	2020-02-27T00:00:00Z	This app is a fantastic addition to our store and the customer service is great.  I recently got stuck with one setting and their customer service agent (Priyanka) was extremely helpful and had the issue resolved in a matter of minutes. Highly recommended!	170
18	5	2020-02-26T00:00:00Z	Rushit was great to work with. I appreciate his knowledge with helping our business be more successful. Thanks so much!	171
18	5	2020-02-25T00:00:00Z	Vighnesh was amazing quickly identifying a feature I had not enabled which was impacting on my customers experience.	172
18	5	2020-02-25T00:00:00Z	Daniel was able to assist me in managing our subscription customers. He went in to take a look at our current settings, showed me how to get there and update. Very efficient and easy for me to follow!	173
18	5	2020-02-24T00:00:00Z	Great app. The build-a-box feature is really easy to use. We’re looking forward to better integration with Zapiet’s Store Pickup + Delivery app. The support staff are extremely helpful. Special thanks to Harpreet, Laurel & Vighnesh.	174
18	5	2020-02-24T00:00:00Z	Absolutely amazing app, no biased opinion here. Bold is hands down the best subscription app for shopify, and their support is next level, helped us solve many problems in just minutes, their team is outstanding at locating issues and fixing them without having to ask twice, will be a lifetime customer of bold!	175
18	5	2020-02-24T00:00:00Z	"This App is really Great compare to the app that i've been tried. They have also a Very Very Very AWESOME SUPPORT, they are very helpful, specially Scott, Sarah and Beth. They are ready to help you anytime. Would definitely RECOMMEND BOLD.

-Patrick"	176
18	5	2020-02-21T00:00:00Z	So far so good. Transition was a bit harder than we expected initially but customer support has been great. Thanks to Carter for being super helpful and accommodating!	177
18	5	2020-02-20T00:00:00Z	I had a little bit of trouble figuring out how to change the frequency of our subscriptions shipping. Aryan Sharma was super helpful giving extra tips in terms of coding, which apps to adjust what, and knowing how the backend system works. We love using bold and the customer service is 10/10. Would absolutely recommend this app to anyone looking to starting a subscription!	178
18	5	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	The app is relative easy to use. The app Help and Manuals are quite well written and help out the setting up process.  The best part is Support (Aryan Sharma) that help is fast and competent.	179
18	5	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	Coming over from another subscription app, Ive found Bold to be far more user friendly, less glitchy & their support has also been great.  I have spoken to two support reps so far (Kelsey & Alexa) who helped me out straight away.	180
19	4	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	I use this app to process payments for a subscription based wine club. It is excellent and easy to use. Customer service is prompt and helpful. My one complaint / wish is that it would be possible to update order dates for multiple customers together, rather than having to update each one manually which is quite cumbersome and feels like a waste of time.	181
19	5	2020-04-13T00:00:00Z	"I am almost at the end of my free period and I will continue using this app. I was on the fence between Bold Subscription and Recharge, and I am very happy with my decision. It really came down to customer support and the team at Bold delivers on that. A special thanks to Sukh for helping me. The functionality is what I was looking for to provide a greater level of convenience to our customers.

Update: We are updating to a new theme and Priyanka and the team are helping us to add Subscriptions to it. There customer service is always great and easy to get a hold of. We have been using this app for almost 4 months."	182
19	5	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	Bold app is great. Just launched my subscription company and not only does it work well but support is very helpful, and fast, when I have questions. Sukh assisted me today and helped me figure out something within minutes.	183
19	5	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	The customer service chat bot directly in the app is very helpful and accessible whenever I have a question. It's not buggy and connects you with a customer service rep right away. Specifically, Carter and Melody were extremely helpful and responsive with an issue I was having. They were promptly able to provide detailed instructions and recommendations on an issue I had initially thought was unsolvable and complicated.	184
19	4	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	Noticed a bug with our setup and had a hard time fixing it at first. Spoke to 3 different reps at bold about the issue (live chat and on phone) and shopify reps prior to the call, but none was able to resolve. Some even suggested hiring freelance coders - which made no sense. Eventually, the issues was escalated to Simranjit at bold, who I met over the phone and was great.  He quickly resolved our issue and was super pleasant. Would give him more than 5 stars if could	185
19	5	2020-02-18T00:00:00Z	Simran was very knowledgeable and helpful in integrating bold with my zapier. Thanks Simran you were very appreciated.	186
19	5	2020-02-18T00:00:00Z	"update: I needed some extra assistance for Carter's recommendation. Samantha came in to save the day (& my sanity). Above & beyond the call of duty - she deserves 2 pieces of cake today. 

I needed a specific way to set up a subscription that allows the customer to pay biannually but get their items monthly. Carter was quick to come up with a solution that should work, even though it's not directly offered. Really appreciate all his help!"	187
19	5	2020-02-15T00:00:00Z	Great app, awesome live chat support from Regina and Priyanka today. Fast and friendly, and knew how to answer my questions. 10/10 recommend for subscriptions.	188
19	5	2020-02-14T00:00:00Z	Taylor was quick and helpful - and the app itself seems both simple to use and powerful in its feature-set.	189
19	5	2020-02-14T00:00:00Z	Carter is the Guy ! He is helping me building my suscription website in one day ! I think I will LOVE Bold	190
20	5	2020-02-13T00:00:00Z	Mayankkumar Patel Was able to help me with a coupon code issue and was very persistent in resolving everything for me. Thank you!	191
20	5	2020-02-12T00:00:00Z	Thanks to this Bold app we improved our recurring order solution. Thanks to Aryan Sharma and Kelsey for making a great app even better!	192
20	5	2020-02-12T00:00:00Z	Thanks to Bold's Chat Support Representative, Priyanka for assisting me. He's able to resolve my issue in no time!	193
20	5	2020-02-26T00:00:00Z	It's been fantastic! The customer service is incredible. Carter is exceptionally knowledgeable and professional.  Couldn't be happier with this app!	194
20	5	2020-02-12T00:00:00Z	This is a great app. It also has great customer service live chat. I love bold. Thanks, everyone over there! Priyanka was so helpful!	195
20	5	2020-02-11T00:00:00Z	Highly recommend! The support team are amazing and a special thank you to Carter & Melody. They were able to help with additional coding requests and task were completed successfully in a very timely manner! Thanks again team you guys have been amazing!	196
20	5	2020-02-11T00:00:00Z	"The number one reason I love Bold is that there's always someone available at support.
Today it was Vighnesh,  very knowledgeable and full of patience"	197
20	5	2020-02-10T00:00:00Z	I just finished setting up my subscription products and Chintan was an amazing help. The whole team had me set up and ready to sell in one day!!	198
20	5	2020-03-26T00:00:00Z	Whenever I need help, assistance is quick and we get it resolved quickly. Thanks to Daniel who resolved my latest issue!	199
20	5	2020-02-08T00:00:00Z	Very happy with the easy navigation and helpful customer service. Just got off chat with Cody and he and all the other staff that have helped me in the past have been great to work with.	200
21	4	2020-02-06T00:00:00Z	Very helpful. Especially the support is fantastic. Carter was an incredible person who assisted me with simple things patiently and also answered some hard questions	201
21	5	2020-04-27T00:00:00Z	I have issue with the app and Aryan Sharma helped me out about it. Thanks for great customer service. Loving this app.	202
21	5	2020-02-06T00:00:00Z	I'm just getting started with the app but am very pleased so far. My review is about the excellent tech support. The help I needed was simple but necessary to get started. Jonnathan had me up and running very quickly, even faster than I had hoped. I used to work for a software startup that was successful because of our awesome support, so I greatly appreciate when I experience a great team as a user. Thanks Jonnathan for helping me out so quickly and being professional.	203
21	5	2020-02-04T00:00:00Z	Luminous beings are Bold staff, not this crude non-recurring matter. Thanks Baby Yoda for your insights and wisdom.	204
21	5	2020-02-03T00:00:00Z	Great customer service - Sukh was fast and super helpful getting my subscription settings set up the way I wanted!	205
21	5	2020-01-31T00:00:00Z	great customer service! Chintan was very patient with me in figuring out/solving my problem...thanks!	206
21	5	2020-01-31T00:00:00Z	I was a little confused at first as this is a really powerful app with lots of features, but one quick live chat with Sam and I got everything working perfectly. This app really is a dream if you want to do subscription boxes, but it really does do so much more!	207
21	5	2020-05-15T00:00:00Z	Priyanka was extremely helpful and quick to fix our issue! She was amazing! The app is also extremely Amazing! Highly recommend!	208
21	5	2020-01-30T00:00:00Z	Priyanka and Clifford were very kind, while making sure they understood my issue so they could best assist us. Great support!	209
21	5	2020-01-30T00:00:00Z	Cody is awesome!!!! I was having some issues and was told via chat that someone would reach out to me. The issue was pretty time sensitive so I was a little worried that I wouldnt hear back from anyone soon. The chat ended with the original support and right when I was about to close the screen, Cody hopped on explained and resolved my issue. Thank you again	210
22	5	2020-01-30T00:00:00Z	Priyanka's been great, she's helped me every time that I have talked to her and has made sure that the issue is either resolved or that I will have a follow-up!	211
22	5	2020-02-19T00:00:00Z	Bold support is so helpful! I have gotten a lot of support clarifying all my questions and helping me to learn my way around from people like Sukh. Thanks Bold!	212
22	5	2020-01-29T00:00:00Z	Chintan with Bold SUbscriptions helped me through all of my questions quickly and everything was resolved! Thanks Chintan!	213
22	5	2020-04-09T00:00:00Z	I was on Chat s with Aryan and she was Super helpful!! She provided me with a lot of contexts and a lot of useful information.	214
22	5	2020-01-28T00:00:00Z	"I chat with Support (Priyanka). I had many questions about the app and it was able to help me in all areas. So really good support ! 
Thank you Priyanka!!"	215
22	5	2020-01-27T00:00:00Z	We love this app.  It has been a consistently reliable way to provide subscription options for our coffee roasting business.  Jonnathan was also a huge help when we discovered a coding issue that hindered check out.  He found the issue and fixed it in a matter of 24-48 hours.  Excellent service.	216
22	2	2020-01-24T00:00:00Z	"We lost about $2000 worth in goods through this app. Their functionality has been a good help to our business and their support is great. Both of those did not take away that the integration of their payment gateways is compromised.

Through an exploit in the app, an automated attack allowed to place orders with fraudulent credit card data. Whilst the payment gateway (Authorize.net) itself flagged these payments, Bold (or the third party they use for this) did not pick up on these flags and marked all payments as successful. We only found these activities by chance.

To me this was a huge trust-breaker, given this software is using payments for the majority of it's functionality. Even worse, they were the last party to respond (after Shopify and Authorize.net) when it became clear we ran into problems.

Even though the solution works, it cost us more than it delivered in the end. Which is a very sad story."	217
22	5	2020-01-24T00:00:00Z	Carter did an amazing job! Great patience and careful instructions to get the job done right! Alexa did a great job in helping second hand also. Shoutouts to Carter once again!	218
22	5	2020-01-24T00:00:00Z	Just started using Bold Subscriptions, but had a question about how to use the buy button.  Samantha was a super help through chat!  Quick & attentive & super knowledgeable, which in my book is gold!	219
22	5	2020-04-28T00:00:00Z	I love using Bold! Their customer service team is always quick to help and make sure I understand everything. Having their help at my fingertips is worth the cost alone! Shoutout to Vighnesh for helping me allow a customer to upgrade their subscription service!	220
23	5	2020-01-23T00:00:00Z	This app is exactly what my website needed.  This app is easy to install and customize.  You can customize just about anything and having the option for a flexible subscription for one or more products fills all of my needs.  Their customer service is OUTSTANDING!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone that has products that they want to include a subscription to.	221
23	5	2020-03-05T00:00:00Z	Laurel was so helpful in answering all my questions.  I just love how easy it is to get support with this app when you need it!	222
23	5	2020-01-22T00:00:00Z	I have tried literally every Shopify subscription app and Bold is the only one that offers the features and functions remotely close to what I need. I had a little trouble getting it set up at first but Abhi with their support team was amazing and patient while taking the time to thoroughly understand and help resolve my issue.	223
23	5	2020-01-20T00:00:00Z	Just getting started today and ran into some difficulties (user error on my end).  I was able to jump on live chat and Sukh had me up and running in no time.  It is very important to me to have quick response time and after waiting only a few minutes in the live chat queue, I was able to get multiple questions answered.  Thanks again Sukh.	224
23	5	2020-01-18T00:00:00Z	We switched to this app after moving from WooCommerce to Shopify, and it 100% changed our business for the better. Gone are the days of total confusion and SO MUCH WORK in woo subscriptions - Bold Recurring Orders is AMAZING for both US and our customers!!!! I have worked with many of the employees here, from dealing with the major & lengthy process of migrating from WooCommerce, to little glitches and additional customizations, etc, and they have all been incredible and go above and beyond every time. Thank you Bold for all of your help for being such amazing people!	225
23	5	2020-01-17T00:00:00Z	I do not have the app up and running just yet but the experience getting assistance from Priyanka running test purchases for subscriptions was a great help!  Excited to get this app running for our customers!	226
23	5	2020-01-17T00:00:00Z	"I just switched to Bold subscriptions for another app. For me there have been two key differences. One is the easy option to enable a required Terms and Conditions checkbox on checkout. Yes, you can code this in but it can be tricky to figure it out when you are redirecting to a subscription cart. Having a toggle option in the settings is so much easier. 
The second difference is chat support. We had a small issue with the install where our theme code didn't line up with their tutorial. We were able to msg with Laurel through their chat feature then she connected us on to Taylor who took a look at our code and helped us right away. This is way better than a back and forth email chain with lots of different people answering the 'support' email box.
The app has lots of features we won't be using right away, for custom boxes etc. but its good to know we have options to expand/grow,"	227
23	5	2020-01-16T00:00:00Z	This app is great! It has been easy to set up and any time I had questions I used the live chat feature. Mayank helped me and was extremely responsive and helpful!	228
23	5	2020-01-16T00:00:00Z	Taylor was very quick and effecient. We have been satisfied with the Bold app so far and look forward to using it again.	229
23	4	2020-01-15T00:00:00Z	I've been using the app now for a few months and it seems to do what I need it to do, but not always intuitively. Chat is very helpful, especially Priyanka. Email correspondence is a little more lengthy.	230
24	5	2020-01-15T00:00:00Z	"I had some issues with my website and Abhi was very helpful.
Thank you so much for the excellent service!"	231
24	5	2020-01-14T00:00:00Z	Kelsey helped me to solve a refund issue I was having and she was quick and efficient to get to the root of the problem. I am glad I initiated a chat and saved myself a lot of time with her help	232
24	5	2020-01-13T00:00:00Z	Kelsey was quick to answer my questions and get tickets going for my problems.  I hope to have my site up and running tomorrow.	233
24	5	2020-01-13T00:00:00Z	Kelsey was very helpful in the install process of Bold, she answered questions timely and thoroughly. Thank you!	234
24	5	2020-01-10T00:00:00Z	Kelsey, Jordan and Alexa were all super helpful with some quick and easy fixes that I just couldn't figure out on my own! Thanks for the speedy response! So awesome!	235
24	4	2020-01-10T00:00:00Z	It's been fairly easy to use. Sometimes the support can take a long time to work through things. However, Kelsey in the support team was very helpful and quick with my customer support issues.	236
24	5	2020-01-23T00:00:00Z	"UPDATE: 
I spoke with Sukh to help me with subscription plan for BOLD. I had a lot of questions and Sukh asked me a lot of clarifying questions and was very helpful with guiding me set up the plan. Thank you Sukh. 

I am in the process of downloading the BOLD subscription. I was hesitant to use the automatic download so I used the chat helpline. Kelsey made the process very easy for me and patiently walked me through the steps on how to start. Thank you Kelsey!"	237
24	5	2020-01-09T00:00:00Z	Snigdha helped with my install and communication was great and install was fast. So far the app is as advertised and more!	238
24	5	2020-01-09T00:00:00Z	"We just started our business in August and we’ve been very happy so far with the over all service that bold provides us along with our customers. When I have questions there is someone there to answer my questions and solve my issues. Thank you for everything that the bold team does. 
The only negative remark would be the wait time on the phone to speak with a agent."	239
24	5	2020-01-09T00:00:00Z	Great app with great functionality and great support. Can't ask for much more. I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking for subscription feature on Shopify.	240
25	4	2020-01-08T00:00:00Z	The service and support was awesome. I installed the app, but had some issues with my theme afterwards (Parallax Theme), namely the Add to Cart button stopped working and the product images stopped opening in a pop-up, but rather as a new page... (hard to explain, but basically you would have to click the back button instead of just clicking away from the image to close it...). Anyway, Sukh helped me out and the team got right on fixing the issues.	241
25	5	2020-01-08T00:00:00Z	I use Bold Subscriptions for Subscribe and Save. The app works great as well as support. Thanks to Kelsey and Alexas for the help in fixing our issues.	242
25	5	2020-01-07T00:00:00Z	Great help from bold support (Snigdha, Ankur & Nikki) looking forward for better results. Thank you and keep it up :)	243
25	5	2020-01-07T00:00:00Z	The very helpful team (Cody) has talked me through, on the web chat, setting up the Manage Subscriptions page. Thanks!!	244
25	5	2020-01-07T00:00:00Z	Great help in the chat with Priyanka, was patient and resourceful. First time using this app, looking for some good results.	245
25	5	2020-01-06T00:00:00Z	Just got some amazing customer service from Brenda. Very quick and professional and gave me some additional pointers that I wasn't aware of. Thank you Brenda!	246
25	5	2020-01-03T00:00:00Z	I had some complicated issues to sort out with my stores pages and links.  Cody and Melody from BOLD did a great job of walking me through the steps.  The BOLD subscriptions app has been great for growing my business.  I would recommend it to other shopify users.	247
25	5	2020-01-03T00:00:00Z	This app does pretty much everything we need it too and the customer service is excellent! Definitely recommend!	248
25	5	2020-01-02T00:00:00Z	So far everything has been great, the product does what it says it does! I have had to ask a couple of questions along the way and Bold is very responsive and helpful! Thanks for your support, also a special shoutout to Daniel who helped me through chat when I was in a pickle!	249
25	5	2020-01-02T00:00:00Z	"I recently began using the BOLD Recurring and Subscription App on our Shopify store and although it was more complex than expected as we are using a custom Shopify theme, Mayank at BOLD Support answered us promptly and efficiently and was amazing. 

They are very responsive and even provided us with FREE expert installation. 

A great start so far..."	250
26	5	2019-12-30T00:00:00Z	customer service was awesome!! Kelsey helped me through all my questions and trust me i had alot lol. i was treated with such patience and professionalism. After directing me on how to execute i felt confident i could. Thank you again Kelsey!	251
26	5	2019-12-30T00:00:00Z	Great customer service! Kelsey and Priyanka were great and VERY helpful :-) Just getting started but Bold subscription looks like it is going to do what I need it to do.	252
26	5	2020-04-21T00:00:00Z	Priyanka and Carter always gets it done for me! So happy with her help. It is a great app and I would recommend it.	253
26	5	2020-01-28T00:00:00Z	Friendly service, helpful live chat function. Works well for coffee roaster subscription integrations. Was able to sort us out with some teething issues with our subscription issues. Robust reporting!	254
26	5	2019-12-27T00:00:00Z	I had a great experience while reaching out for help. I worked with Abhishek. He was super helpful, efficient and polite!	255
26	5	2019-12-27T00:00:00Z	Love this app for my Doggy Treat Box subscription box business. We sell 100% natural dog treats and toys mainly to the UK. Priyanka was very helpful when asking for support. Thanks BOLD.	256
26	5	2019-12-23T00:00:00Z	Getting this app set up now - so can't comment on the functionality yet. But Priyanka from the support team was very helpful and explained everything to me, and pointed me in the right direction on how to get set up quickly.	257
26	5	2019-12-20T00:00:00Z	really good app, easy to use and support is great.........................................................................	258
26	5	2019-12-20T00:00:00Z	Great Product, A++ Support - Very easy to use, easy integration, works great and exactly what was described.	259
26	5	2019-12-20T00:00:00Z	Chintan and Rebecca gave great customer support, they went above and beyond to solve my issue quickly! Highly Recommended!	260
27	5	2020-04-03T00:00:00Z	"[Updated on 4/3/2020]
Aryan Sharma has been very helpful in checking the issue and was very patient on my question. Great customer service!

Nowadays, a reoccurring revenue is the lifeblood of many businesses. This bold app makes it super simple and easy to manage reoccurring orders. Although I rarely need to talk to support, when I do they are responsive and super helpful. Specifically, I talked to Priyanka and she was one of the best support agents I've ever talked to!"	261
27	5	2019-12-20T00:00:00Z	"We have been using this app and the app is really cool. the customer support team is great. Chintan helped me a lot to troubleshoot a problem.
Thanks Chintan. :)"	262
27	5	2019-12-19T00:00:00Z	Customer service was great.  Kelsey was very helpful.  Answered 3 of my questions specifically.  Thanks	263
27	5	2019-12-19T00:00:00Z	Kelsey was super helpful and quick to offer solutions! We haven't had any issues with the software but have needed to add/remove client facing options based on feedback.	264
27	5	2019-12-19T00:00:00Z	Kelsey was a super helpful individual with assisting me with my needs. Bold should promote her to a lead position. My issues got dealt with accordingly	265
27	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	I worked with Priyanka to resolve a subscription issue.  Priyanka was professional, courteous, and timely.  Very very happy with the outcome.	266
27	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	Cody was very patient with assisting helping us set up subscriptions. He has a lot of expertise and we enjoy Bold. Their support team is great.	267
27	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	Kelsey is amazingly patient and efficient. I am so grateful for the assistance and dedication to making my store's new subscription service perfect. I highly recommend everything about Bold!	268
27	4	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	This has the nuts and bolts but does need an external experts if you want to add other functionality like gift subscriptions and making that process seamless for the customer. Chintan was helpful in walking me through the functionality.	269
27	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	Great app. It does exactly what I need it to do. Customer service is always excellent, Kelsey helped me with my issue right away!	270
28	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	We've been using the app for months and it works great for subscriptions. The app has many configurations to customize it to your needs and the support has been top notch! Support is very responsive and works hard to get hour question or issue resolved to your satisfaction. I definitely recommend this app to others looking for subscription functionality. We also use their other apps with the same high quality result!	271
28	5	2019-12-23T00:00:00Z	I had a previously negative experience with Bold. But then Oli came to the rescue and was just SO courteous, helpful, and kind. He is a real asset to Bold and restored my faith in the company. Customer service like what Oli provided is so impressive and wonderful, Thank you for helping Oli and merry christmas to you!	272
28	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	Awesome customer service and super fast reply! Their support team took care of everything that needed to be done after I switched to a new theme. Great work!	273
28	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	This app does exactly what it says, and the customer support was very helpful and always responded quickly!	274
28	3	2019-12-17T00:00:00Z	Using emails for support has been frustrating.  User friendly interface.  However, my entire issue could have been answered or explained with a 3 to 5 minute conversation. Yet it’s been back and forth (due to follow ups) over several days using email support, which is frustrating.	275
28	5	2019-12-16T00:00:00Z	Thanks to Bold Support Team (Pratibha, Ankur & Clifford). They installed liquid code for us just in one day. Supper fast response!	276
28	5	2019-12-16T00:00:00Z	Chintan was extremely helpful today. He was patient and courteous getting me started using Bold app connected to my shopify page.	277
28	5	2019-12-16T00:00:00Z	"Sukh and Cody were amazing! They helped me setup the ""manage my subscription"" for my customers in a matter of minutes. Thanks guys!!"	278
28	5	2019-12-16T00:00:00Z	"I used this app to have reccurring orders and it workd very good! The Helping center was good too!
Thank you"	279
28	5	2019-12-16T00:00:00Z	"Sukh and Rebecca with Bold continue to work quickly to resolve my website issues.  They are very professional and courteous.  I enjoy working with them.
Great customer service!"	280
29	5	2019-12-13T00:00:00Z	Dylan was a miracle worker! I was having an issue with my button color and it blocking the font and I was unable to fix it myself. Dylan quickly figured out the issue, found a solution and solved the problem. He was patient, helpful, kind and saved the day. Great app and customer service!	281
29	5	2019-12-12T00:00:00Z	Rahul was supper fast and helpful! This app has been great and the customer service is great. I would definitely recommend if you want to have a subscription based product.	282
29	5	2019-12-11T00:00:00Z	"Thank you bold, and special thanks to "" Chintan "". he is amazing guy. he solved  my bold subscription problems, Thank you Chintan.

You are great BRO"	283
29	5	2019-12-10T00:00:00Z	Super helpful with installation into my theme...made the process very fast and easy. Strongly recommend!	284
29	1	2019-12-09T00:00:00Z	I would not recommend this app. The customer service is pleasant, but frustratingly not able to assist. I really wanted this app to work, but the setup process is a nightmare, and there is/are no clear instructions on what to do once you have the app installed. If you have a lot of inventory, you can't use subscription, only recurring cart. Which you can get for a fraction of what Bold subscription is from other apps.	285
29	5	2019-12-06T00:00:00Z	Clifford assisted me with a problem I was having with our reoccurring subscriptions.  Our subscription service is complicated as it goes out every other month and we allow people to pay up front or as you go.  He showed me how to set up the correct products in the collection on Shopify and then how to link them to the corrected settings in the BOLD app.  Since this was originally incorrectly set up by a company we hired to design our website, we did not know what to fix. He explained how the app works and made sure everything was working properly, and that I could make future corrections.  I couldn't be more pleased with Clifford. Clifford is the reason the app is now working well for us. He must be the most patient, helpful, kind person I've had the pleasure of working with.  He helped me fix a problem that has been plaguing our business for over a year.  THANK YOU CLIFFORD!	286
29	5	2020-01-31T00:00:00Z	"Received the help i need from Chintan! 

Bold definitely has earned my loyalty thanks to their customer support team. Thanks team! -Allen"	287
29	5	2019-12-03T00:00:00Z	"I need help with a feature not seeming to work and I reached out to their support and they have been extremely helpful!
Shoutout to Rahul and Sukh!"	288
29	5	2019-12-02T00:00:00Z	I downloaded the Bold Subscription app and I first attempted to create the subscription page - that did not work.  So I enlisted the help of the Bold Team. They had everything up and running quickly. When I logged in I could not see the subscription info so I chatted with Dylan. Dylan had the patience to guide my ineptness through it all, he made some tweaks and it was running perfectly.  The entire Bold Support team are top notch and professional.  Dylan was by far outstanding and is a credit to Bold.  I am 150% satisfied with Bold and extremely happy. Thank you so much.	289
29	5	2019-12-01T00:00:00Z	The app is just the solution that we needed for managing our season ticket sales. The support that comes with it is even better. 'Guided' through the process is an understatement. Handheld would be more accurate. First rate experience.	290
30	5	2019-11-30T00:00:00Z	After experiencing some problems during setup. Taylor C resolved my issue in no time  great app with even greater employee’s .	291
30	5	2019-11-29T00:00:00Z	Chintan helped us with this app and he was wonderful. Gave us a lot of information. Not sure how the app is going to perform but the customer service was wonderful.	292
30	5	2020-03-18T00:00:00Z	AMAZING support! Daniel was very very helpful and understanding. The app was all we needed for our business to continue growing. 100% recommended.	293
30	5	2019-11-29T00:00:00Z	The customer service is fast and perfect. I recommand this app for launch your subscriptions system. Thank you	294
30	5	2019-11-29T00:00:00Z	"The customer support that Leanne provided was absolutely phenomenal. 24 hour support was great for Black Friday and was really nice to be able to talk to a real person at 2 in the morning to get my problems fixed. 

Other than that, the app still could use some more functionality and seamlessness, wasn't able to get the feature I needed because some of the work is still in the pipeline. Nevertheless I had a great interaction with customer support and learned a lot of things about shopify in general!"	295
30	5	2020-05-05T00:00:00Z	Rushit is the best and so helpful! I needed some help with coding on subscriptions and he walked through it with me in detail to help me understand what to do moving forward!	296
30	5	2019-11-27T00:00:00Z	I always feel intimidated by integrating apps into my site but Bold makes it easy and with team members like Cody in customer service answering any silly questions I may have, it's a no-brainer!!!	297
30	5	2019-11-28T00:00:00Z	Jennifer was a huge help and she taught me something.  Only been using it for a couple months but seems good so far.  ..	298
30	5	2019-11-25T00:00:00Z	Great App - Had 2 issues over 2 days and both time CS were able to remedy the issue. Thank you Cody and Kelsey	299
30	5	2019-11-23T00:00:00Z	Bold Subscriptions get better and better every year.  Also, customer service is fantastic.  I've had several questions ranging from simple to complex, including new feature requests. Just today (a Saturday) I asked for a new feature and in less than an hour, Rebecca had made the change and my website was updated.  Thank you for a fantastic product and service!	300
31	1	2019-11-22T00:00:00Z	I really wanted this app to work but with at 18 step installation process that makes no sense at step 3 (Add something that doesn't exist and click the Continue button that also does not exist) is ridiculous. Tried chat and they were not able to help either. There was no way that I could make it work or use it online.	301
31	5	2019-11-22T00:00:00Z	Abhishek and Melody spent a fair amount of time with me on a number of issues in my store. They spoke with experts on an issue with many aspects of my customers' experience. They were very helpful and worked with me when there were process flows that needed updating. This highly responsive technical team is so helpful every day, and very quick to answer any questions.	302
31	5	2019-11-22T00:00:00Z	I had all my questions answered in a timely fashion by Rahul. I enjoy using all the features this app. holds.	303
31	5	2019-11-22T00:00:00Z	Just downloaded this apps coupke days ago, so I haven't gotten the full use of it, however their customer service is amazing, and they get the job done! The app so far is working well after having it altered to suit the needs of my store. I'm really liking it! Thank you to the guys who assisted me	304
31	5	2019-11-21T00:00:00Z	"it would be nice to let customers add products (one time) to their subscriptions!
customer service is great!"	305
31	5	2020-02-04T00:00:00Z	Customer service always on point. Cody saved me what was probably many days of figuring out a problem, and did it very quickly.	306
31	5	2019-11-20T00:00:00Z	Sukh was incredibly responsive and knowledgeable and was able to help me with all of the issues/questions I had. I certainly recommend Bold, with CS like this!	307
31	5	2019-11-20T00:00:00Z	Kelsey was very helpful! Helped me organize my subscriptions before our launch date! Very thankful Kelsey and for the quick customer service	308
31	5	2019-11-20T00:00:00Z	We recently migrated our store from a custom app to Bold Subscriptions. While it wasn't fun editing our massive CSV export from the old system to match Bold's template, the migration specialist assigned to us on Bold's side has been fantastic—knowledgeable, positive, a true problem-solver for our atypical subscription model (Thank you, Val!). After launching the site, app specialist Harpreet has been fast and effective implementing some last-minute CSS customization (Thank you, Harpreet). All in all, every contact with Bold's support team has been a positive experience. Congratulations to the senior team for encouraging a great company culture!	309
31	5	2019-11-20T00:00:00Z	I am so happy with the BOLD app.  I had an issue with my subscription product and an addition I wanted to make.  Rebecca was amazing!!!!!!!  She not only fixed my issue with ease, she helped add a drop down on my Shopify site for a non-subscription product.  She is a find.  Thank you BOLD for everything.	310
32	5	2019-11-20T00:00:00Z	I've used this app now across 3 stores. Every time it's proven itself valuable and the service is excellent. It's relatively easy to configure and we've gotten up and running with no help in less than 20 minutes each time. When we did need help, we used their chat and Chintan is a support Ninja! Definitely recommended for reoccurring revenue.	311
32	5	2019-11-20T00:00:00Z	Cody was very helpful with  getting my manage my subscriptions page up and running properly ! Thanks ‘!	312
32	5	2019-11-19T00:00:00Z	"Their support is amazing. Resolved my issues so quickly and the app does the job as we expected!!

Easy to use, can be integrated with other apps, and many features we can customize our subscriptions how we want.

Great app and we highly recommend."	313
32	5	2019-11-19T00:00:00Z	I was assisted by Chintan Trikha, very helpful gentleman. He answered all my questions and provided me with exceptional service. Chintan you are the best bold representative ever, you deserve a raise. keep up the good work :)	314
32	5	2019-11-14T00:00:00Z	Incredibly easy to get started, support is great and helps keep things rolling when there are questions about how to handle a particular scenario. Highly recommend. Thanks Cody!	315
32	5	2019-11-13T00:00:00Z	"Great app, fantastic customer service! 
Still needs some more customization but it will probably work for most use cases."	316
32	5	2019-11-13T00:00:00Z	I'm in the trial stage of using this app and customer service is great for someone who doesn't know how to do all these intimidating website things. Chintan was a great help!	317
32	5	2019-11-12T00:00:00Z	Needed checkout customized for my specific purposes, and Abhishek helped out and had me set within minutes,  very responsive and helpful support!	318
32	5	2019-11-08T00:00:00Z	Loved you guys as a merchant, adore you even more working as a partner! Thanks for all you do at Bold for us & our clients! :D	319
32	5	2019-11-07T00:00:00Z	We've been using this app for a few years. We often have questions and want to tweak our website and BOLD always comes to the rescue! It's an App we can trust!	320
33	5	2019-11-06T00:00:00Z	"Feature rich and easy to use. This app has been effortless to manage. The support has been outstanding and a huge time saver which is critical with these apps.
Thanks Bold!!"	321
33	5	2019-11-05T00:00:00Z	"I have used this app for over 2 years across 3 Shopify stores. Recurring/subscribed sales account for a major part of our business and it would not be possible without this app.

But an app is an app, its kind of just a utility until you need to work with the company to resolve something. This is where the Bold team really shines. Bold is continually updating their offerings and on the few occasions where we've needed help from support they have been phenomenal. A great test of a company is what happens when something isn't quite right and Bold has earned taking my time to write a 5 star review on this point alone.

Just today, I used their little chat button to let them know of a very minor issue I was having and it turned into an entire brainstorming session on how to get different apps working together and what the ""real"" game plan for BFCM was going to be. Thank you so much to Regina for taking the time to do that I really appreciate it! She had to go check with people multiple times on my crazy ideas and stuck with me the whole way.

I don't usually write reviews. It took 2 years for me to post this. If I could give 6 stars or a higher level of praise I would. Thanks for sticking with us Bold!"	322
33	5	2019-11-04T00:00:00Z	Fast and great customer support! I jump on their chat support when needed and they always are able to figure out and help me thru the issue.	323
33	5	2019-10-30T00:00:00Z	"There are two key things to consider when choosing an app, it's functionality and the support offered by the developer. Bold are phenomenal with both aspects!

The subscriptions app does everything we could wish for and has added a tremendous amount of value to our business - and our customers.

The support we received to get the app up and running has been first-class. Julian has gone above and beyond to help out. Thank you! 

I can't recommend Bold enough...."	324
33	5	2019-10-29T00:00:00Z	Always helpful. Thanks Chintan. - This is the easiest software I have found to date / use it on both of my Shopify stores.	325
33	5	2019-10-28T00:00:00Z	Great customer service from Sukh - answered all my questions around fulfilment. And getting the app installed	326
33	5	2019-10-28T00:00:00Z	So far im very happy, not only with the product but also the service. I was previously using recharge and wish I had migrated sooner. Bold offers so much more flexibility and an easier to use platform. Lucas is one of the migration specialists and he has been very quick to try and get the app up and running on my site! Thanks for all the support Bold.	327
33	5	2019-10-24T00:00:00Z	Truly amazing customer service! Deeply appreciate Sukh assisting me with an issue I was having. Love the instant chat feature to quickly get assistance. Sukh truly provided excellent service and I am so thankful.  -Erin	328
33	5	2019-10-23T00:00:00Z	Great support! I love asking questions and getting a quick and great response. I have been helped by Rahul multiple times. They have always been a great help to me and very understanding. Thank you for the awesome work. Keep it up!	329
33	5	2019-10-23T00:00:00Z	Thanks for your time today, PJ.  I have been using Bold Subscriptions for 1.5 years and I've been very pleased.  Glad to see that the team is continuing to progress the app's features.	330
34	4	2019-10-22T00:00:00Z	"The app is great for Subscription products/services. It has most of the functionality incorporated in it. 
Alexa (Support) helped me understand and setup/ configure the App. She quickly responded to clarify my queries. It was great working with her.
Anyone  can test out the App with trail version before making a decision to buy."	331
34	5	2019-10-21T00:00:00Z	Rahul was the man! Helped me with all my questions and was able to get everything ready to go for my store!	332
34	5	2019-10-18T00:00:00Z	Sukh was very helpful. Customer support for Bold is first class. I look forward to continuing a partnership.	333
34	5	2019-10-18T00:00:00Z	Cody was very helpful with my questions and made the process quick, easy, and stress free. 5 stars all around.	334
34	5	2019-10-18T00:00:00Z	I have been using Bold for about 6 months, and have since tripled my membership. They have a robust system, great customer service, and helped me migrate easily from the other subscription platform I was using. Specifically, Rose, Lucas and Melody have been great help to me.	335
34	5	2019-10-17T00:00:00Z	They have an amazing product and are super speedy with customer service! If you are looking for a well rounded with lots of options subscription this is your guy!	336
34	5	2020-04-16T00:00:00Z	Mayankkumar helped me with all my questions regarding refunds and subscription set up with Bold. He was very accomodating with my request for a phone call. Once on the phone he assisted and walked me through every query I had, in a polite and thorough way. Thanks again Mayankkumar for the excellent customer support. - Joel	337
34	5	2019-10-16T00:00:00Z	"Great support in general. Cody was great and the chat is very helpful as a support tool.

Would be great to have a better API and test environments. But that's a Shopify problem in general."	338
34	5	2019-10-14T00:00:00Z	Works well to provide recurring orders. Setup was simple. Unforeseen issues were quickly followed up and resolved by the Jonnathan. Great experience.	339
34	5	2019-10-11T00:00:00Z	Customer support is great. Working on a custom integration with our Shopify store and had to reach out. Cody from customer support answered my questions and put on a path to getting our issue figured out.	340
35	5	2019-10-10T00:00:00Z	"Excellent customer service.  Val, Sarah, and the other staff are really great at communication and in a timely manner.  The assistance that is provided with set-up, troubleshooting is really great.  It's nice to work with a team that is attentive to the needs of the customer.  
I've had so many questions and they were all answered.  I've needed to migrate customers from one platform to the other and they did that for me seamlessly.

I highly recommend working with Bold."	341
35	5	2019-10-10T00:00:00Z	I needed help figuring out how to change a price in recurring orders.  Cody was extremely helpful and my issue was easily fixed in less than a minute!	342
35	5	2019-10-09T00:00:00Z	"This app has been great so far! It has allowed me to setup subscriptions for my customers that provide a discount incentive up-front, and increases their discounts after a certain number of orders. We've also been able to trigger automatic emails to go out to customers in advance of their next recurring order, which is very helpful.

The only issue I've struggled with is getting stuck on allowing our customers to switch their product subscription while in the progressive discount subscription. Cody was able to help me figure out this problem, but I look forward to having it solved by Bold in the near future."	343
35	4	2019-10-09T00:00:00Z	App is fairly easy to use but could have more options for customizing text in order to make the subscriptions ADA compliant. Their support system is great and today Sukh helped with a major issue that needed to be addressed quickly and Sukh helped to fix it within 10 minutes.	344
35	5	2020-01-23T00:00:00Z	This platform is my favorite, and the fact that it'll allow me to sell monthly subscriptions takes it to another level, not to mention the awesome service from tech support to help with all I need, Thanks Kaiser and thank you Cody for the continued assistance! Thanks Sukh for all the additional help! I keep updating my review because I keep reaching out for help, and every time I do, my expectations are exceeded! Bold is by far one of the best companies I've dealt with and that customer support and satisfaction is clearly most important to them, which is not common! Thank you Cody again for the help and support, I wasn't expecting all you were able to do to help me! Abhi, you saved the day man, thank you for your help, thanks for going above and beyond to make sure all I needed help with was taken care of!!	345
35	4	2019-10-08T00:00:00Z	"Great customer service, Rahul was great. The only downside I have run into is that there isn't a function to mass email all of your subscribers at one time, only emails that are sent with certain ""triggers"" ie. info updated, subscription cancelled, card declined etc."	346
35	5	2019-10-04T00:00:00Z	I had an issue, I was try to find the Build a box subscription option. The customer service rep Chintan was quick and will super helpful. I really appreciated that!	347
35	5	2019-10-04T00:00:00Z	"I had an issue where I needed to figure out how to just add the variants of a product and couldn't figure it out.  I contacted the support and a guy named ""Cody"" helped me out.  He was awesome and walked me through it!  5/5 for sure on this app as my first impression!"	348
35	5	2019-10-04T00:00:00Z	its an awesome app for subscription offers, Nd support is chat is very reliable, nd MR. Cody is a nice support member :)	349
35	5	2019-10-03T00:00:00Z	Great app, even better support. Chintan and Laurel have been a big help along with many others on the support team	350
36	5	2019-10-02T00:00:00Z	This app is solid. The functionality is impressive. Also support is great. Nikki has given us really good, prompt replies on all our support requests.	351
36	5	2019-10-01T00:00:00Z	awesome fast help thanks Snigdha! I look forward to seeing how bold subscriptions work out for us :)	352
36	5	2019-10-01T00:00:00Z	I enjoy using this app as it is user-friendly. When I did have an issue I used the online chat. Chintan was very helpful in resolving my issue. Chintan used screenshots to show me what I needed to do and it was so helpful. Now I can do it on my own. Thank you Bold and Chintan	353
36	5	2019-10-01T00:00:00Z	Asked for help and get it today, Thank you Rajni, fixed all my issues for the day. I love app and support	354
36	5	2019-11-21T00:00:00Z	Rajni, Nikki, and Scott were very helpful!  Answered the questions I was asking quickly and linked related articles so I could further educate myself.  Thank you :)	355
36	5	2019-09-30T00:00:00Z	really nice app that is super helpful for my site. The customer support is really nice especially the live chat options. (Cody was the one that helped)	356
36	5	2019-09-30T00:00:00Z	The app is super easy and the chat allows me to get help since I don't know what I am doing :) Laurel was very helpful then I accidently disconnected my chat but Cody took over when I reopened everything and fixed my problem immediately.	357
36	5	2019-09-30T00:00:00Z	Sukh / Harpreet K were able to immediately answer my question with clarity. Great support on this app! Much appreciated :)	358
36	5	2019-09-27T00:00:00Z	Rajni and Melody are great trouble shooters. They really helped me figure out how to fix my subscription issue.	359
36	5	2019-09-26T00:00:00Z	Needed to update my checkout to use Cashier, Got on Chat and Cody was a wizard and got everything done super fast and super easy! Thanks for the quick help!	360
37	5	2019-09-26T00:00:00Z	Talked to Simran on chat, and he was the best support person I've ever talked to. Fixed my problem in a matter of seconds.	361
37	5	2019-09-26T00:00:00Z	Great customer support, thanks Simran! He was able to resolve an issue with my customer account activation in minutes.	362
37	5	2019-09-26T00:00:00Z	Outstanding customer service! (ask for Cody) Our Store uses several Bold apps including recharge, cashier, loyalty and my experience has been excellent. They integrate well with our eCommerce platform and have solid functionality and aesthetic. Our main app is bold recharge which we use to capture subscription auto-renewals. We have a developer that typically does all of the app tailorings but occasionally he is AFK and I have to do some backend work myself on the fly. I understand it for the most part but if If I end up getting stuck, Bold customer support chat always bails me out quickly. A real live person is online right away and they are extremely human and tactful. Recently I had Cody on chat for 45 mins and he helped me with several issues outside of my original support item. This is a huge value feature for us as things can go wrong on the fly and other apps have bot chat support which can be frustrating time wasters. Highly recommend Bold products, they have a quality app for just about everything and their support is fantastic. Thanks Cody!	363
37	5	2019-09-25T00:00:00Z	Honestly some of the best and quick customer service I've ever experienced through an app like Bold Subscriptions.  Harpreet has been super helpful. 5 out of 5 for sure. I also enjoy the ease of use for the subscriptions.  The look and feel fits right in with my website.	364
37	5	2019-12-18T00:00:00Z	I love Bold's live chat feature! Priyanka helped me today and she was so patient while I worked through explaining my issue. She gave me polite and quick answers to get me on my productive way again. The live chat feature is my favorite!! Thank you!	365
37	5	2019-09-24T00:00:00Z	"I just added the app to use for our sock collection. It was confusing at first but customer service stepped in and we're up and running. Seeing subscription requst and it's only been up an hour. Great app.

Eliot Grey"	366
37	1	2019-09-24T00:00:00Z	Stay away from this app. They state they support different gateways, but really they don't. They use a feature within the gateway to save creditcard information, but the problem is, often the gateway still wants the CVC code, so the recurring subsciption fails, and it will cost you a lot of money. Then you think, well i can just switch to stripe, which is well supported by bold, but no Bold Clearly don't want to deal with the problems, they promised 3 days to port the customers.... This has now been going on for 3 months, and bold doesn't do anything to get the problem solved. If you don't write them litteraly all the time, they will just forget about it, and hope someone magically solves the problems for you, because they aren't interested in helping... There exists a ROTTEN culture within BOLD, and the internal comunications. And suddely someone else writes you, and you can waste time trying to explain to this guy all over again, what you have tried to explain the first guy in weeks... I cant seem to get them to help me...	367
37	5	2019-09-23T00:00:00Z	I really enjoy using this app. Very easy to install and to personalize. The support team are fast and works. Thanks.	368
37	5	2019-09-23T00:00:00Z	So far so good! Easy to install, pretty easy to set up (our needs were fairly simple). Had a small issue, sent a chat request, Cody answered and I literally had a resolution in less than 10 seconds, plus Cody gave me a way to fix it myself in the future. Recommend this app!	369
37	5	2019-09-23T00:00:00Z	Had some issues that were addressed by Oli. He was a phenomenal help to me, and got me straightened out. I would recommend this app, along with their team to anyone. VERY flexible, and innovative. Most apps like this are not as customizable, and braod as this one can be for your store. If you find a  function that will not work right away, REACH OUT to them, they may be able to customize it to your liking.	370
38	5	2019-09-21T00:00:00Z	This app provides a great back-end solution to subscriptions. It's easy to use and customize, but more importantly the customer service is great. Kaiser helped me out today through the chat feature and addressed my needs right away. Highly recommended!	371
38	5	2019-09-20T00:00:00Z	Cody and Tony with Subscriptions did a great job. They were very quick to respond, trouble shoot, and fix the issue I had. Great team all around. Thank you!	372
38	5	2019-09-19T00:00:00Z	Sukh was very helpful. and we had the issues sorted out in no time.  he was attentive and thorough with my needs. will review again once customers start ordering.	373
38	5	2019-09-19T00:00:00Z	A big thanks to Rahul for quick problem solving! Great app, really solving a lot of issues we had before installing it.	374
38	5	2019-09-19T00:00:00Z	"5 Star rating for the very good and fast customer service.
The installation can be done automatically, manually or by an expert from bold. The app also provides a very user-friendly interface."	375
38	5	2019-10-22T00:00:00Z	"I used this app, very useful for recurring.
Bold team help you, very nice and helpful. Thanks Taylor, Harpreet, Chintan for install my code and for your help to make sure everything work well.
If you need recurring on your shop do not hesitate."	376
38	5	2019-09-30T00:00:00Z	I am using Bold to drive my subscription workflows. Occasionally I run into configuration problems, but having the chat support is like heaven ! Kaiser was able to provide top class service on chat. Very knowledgeable about the product features and help articles. Was able to solve 5 of my questions in one go that I had been trying to figure out myself but had no joy previously until I went for chat support. I couldn't have been more thankful for his service. 10/10 service.	377
38	5	2019-09-18T00:00:00Z	Live Chat is awesome! Cody went above and beyond to help me get all of my questions answered. Great help!	378
38	5	2019-09-18T00:00:00Z	Like no other app out there! Amazing. Great customer service from Cody! Really helped us out.	379
38	5	2019-12-04T00:00:00Z	Awesome help from Michael on the mail support! Was super helpful and helped resolve the issue. Happy with support.	380
39	5	2019-09-17T00:00:00Z	"Excelent service and great great features. Took a time to completely set up because of all the personalization it provides.

Suppor is very efficient and friendly. Kuddos to Cody"	381
39	5	2019-09-17T00:00:00Z	Great product! Not to mention support for this app is top-notch. I had some major issues trying to get it up and running and Rahul from Bold Support did an excellent job coming through for me in the clutch. Thanks, Bold!	382
39	5	2019-09-16T00:00:00Z	Chintan was a great help, and the support was prompt. The app is so powerfull. Thanks for addressing my issues right away.	383
39	5	2019-09-13T00:00:00Z	Just signed up for this app...so far so good. Customer service is top notch. Thanks for the help, Cody.	384
39	5	2019-09-12T00:00:00Z	Cody was a great help, and the support was prompt. The Subscription box is a life saver. Thanks for addressing my issues right away.	385
39	5	2019-09-12T00:00:00Z	We love the app, it's easy to use and functional. But what is the best part about Bold is their support! They get back to you quickly, offer great and quick support and have great follow up as well.	386
39	5	2019-09-12T00:00:00Z	Cody from support was very quick and helpful in getting a fix applied to the settings on our site. This app has been very easy to use for subscriptions thus far.	387
39	5	2019-09-12T00:00:00Z	Cody's chat support was very helpful with quick and accurate answers. If you have any questions, I would like to consult again soon.	388
39	5	2019-09-17T00:00:00Z	"Just started using this app,  I contacted chat support with a question and talked to Cody..he was a fantastic help and solved my question super quick!!   Thank you so much!!!

Update!  Once again cody was awesome at answering my questions and fixing things!! Thank you!

Update:  I needed assistance again and received awesome support and help from Sukh. You guys rock!"	389
39	4	2019-09-13T00:00:00Z	This app has been greta at helping us with all our recurring orders and subscriptions. All the added features help keep us organized as well! And their customer service has always been helpful. Chintan helped me last time and quickly showed me how to fix an issue that was extremely important for our customers. You won't regret using this app!	390
40	5	2019-09-11T00:00:00Z	Such a fantastic app - and the customer support is unbelievably good! They have live chat and will sort any issues and customise code to help out - I am impressed and then some. Nick and Cody were excellent in the help department. Thumbs up. Recommend this to anyone needing subscriptions on their site	391
40	5	2019-09-11T00:00:00Z	I have been installing mutiple recurring payment apps like partial-ly, and others but bold subscriptions looks like the winner here in terms of features needed. CODY chatbot ninja dude has been extra helpful in getting me set up. WOoohoo!	392
40	5	2019-09-10T00:00:00Z	Excellent service from Jonathan installing the subscription app to our store.  I tried myself but was beyond my ability!  He installed it perfectly and in a timely fashion.  Thank-you!	393
40	5	2019-09-05T00:00:00Z	Great app and customer service - needed some slight customisations making and Cody & Josh were a huge help. Would recommend!	394
40	5	2019-09-04T00:00:00Z	This app is the perfect solution to allow customers to purchase our products on a recurring basis. They get to choose what works best for them, and in turn, that is what's best for us. Customer Service with Bold has also been tremendously helpful with any questions I have come across. Huge thank you to Rajni! All in all, this is an excellent app!	395

Jennifer from support for all the help getting us started! I love all the custom settings and the ability to control subscriptions seamlessly! - NMBC"	396
40	5	2019-09-03T00:00:00Z	This app is terrific. It is easy to use and the tech support is great. I recently needed it integrated into a new theme and Snigdha did a quick and awesome job.	397
40	4	2019-08-30T00:00:00Z	Jennifer is amazing! She was so helpful and kind with getting me set up with this app! She's the best and this app is pretty detailed, but once up and running it's awesome!	398
40	5	2019-08-29T00:00:00Z	This is a fantastic app! Great for making subscription orders convenient and seamless for customers.  Only time we had a problem was when we migrated our account to a new store URL. Cody and Robert efficiently and effectively helped us get back up a running quickly.	399
40	5	2019-08-28T00:00:00Z	Efficient and friendly customer service. Flawless installation carried out by Pratibha from the Bold Commerce team. Looking forward to use it.	400
41	5	2020-03-18T00:00:00Z	Naman was very helpful and made sure my queries were answered professionally and accurately. Thank you for a great service Naman.	401
41	5	2019-08-27T00:00:00Z	Alora is the best she helped me tremendously today I don't know what I would have done without her patience! She gets all the bragging rights!	402
41	5	2019-08-27T00:00:00Z	Great customer service quick and fast responses. Using bold you can do just about any customization you want just needs some tweaking and cooperation. Simran was the representative that helped me and spent over an hour walking me through things. Thank you!	403
41	5	2019-09-11T00:00:00Z	"**Update: One of their app specialist, Cody, contacted me.  He had their team look over and reconfigure my set up.  Turns out that another app was interfering with the functions of the subscription. Fortunately, the customer mentioned in my initial review came back and set up her subscription successfully today.  I do recommend this app and am happy to continue using their services at www.greatmorningscoffeeandtea.com**

I really hope I can update this review with a better rating, but right now I am not happy.  I have a customer who has attempted to do a reoccurring order twice.  The first time the order showed up in my orders as reoccurring, but I later saw that it wasn't in my subscription app.  I assumed she canceled the order.  When her husband contacted me about their order, I told her I didn't have an upcoming order for them and that his wife must have canceled (she confirmed she never did).

After convincing her to try again today, I saw that not only did the order NOT show up in my subscriptions again.  It also gave the discount when the customer added it to their cart but took the discount away at check out (while still showing the tags of what the discount should been).  
Fortunately, this is a very loyal customer and I am working out the details of her order.  But now it worries me to think that I may be missing out on sales because my subscription services seem dishonest and that is reflected on me and my business.  I have submitted an email and tried everything to troubleshoot on my own. But if this can't be worked out quickly, I may need to look into other options.  

I don't know when this became an issue, because my older subscriptions still process without an issue.  But I haven't had a new subscription in months."	404
41	5	2019-08-24T00:00:00Z	"Alexa did a GREAT job making the exact adjustment needed on our website! 

We were only expecting to receive directions on how to make this change ourselves after Bold opened for business on Monday. But no! Alexa went into our site and made this change for us...on a SATURDAY!!!!

Woo hoo! Bold has one happy customer :) Thanks!"	405
41	5	2019-08-28T00:00:00Z	I use Bold to handle our subscription store and it's just amazing. Without knowing anything about subscriptions and how to set up the system, laura from Bold staff helped me with everything she was very kind and helpful.	406
41	4	2019-08-22T00:00:00Z	"Really useful app for adding subscription offers to existing products. Functionally is continually improving, with integration of discounts and a new flow to sto  p customers cancelling.

I had a few teething problems when I switched to Bold Cashier as the two apps didn't talk. However Lucas from Bold was able to fix this for me.

The level of customer service from Bold has been outstanding across all their apps that I use."	407
41	5	2019-08-22T00:00:00Z	Jennifer was very helpful when needing to get my new product variations synced. Getting it synced was extremely easy. I come from the WordPress WOOCOMMERCE world. The support ALONE is worth getting rid of the headaches in the WC WP world. Get on Shopify and use this plugin now. Your time will thank me later.	408
41	5	2019-08-22T00:00:00Z	"I've used many different apps to help us run the subscription product and I think Bold is the best of the best. any apps have its own perks and plus and minus but the most important part of being in this industry is the word ""SUPPORT"".

they have the best SUPPORT system and they will always find a way to help because they do care about you and your business.

I think i have contacted them for 2 reasons, removing / uninstalling the code from my theme and asking them to help me with specific customization.

pay close attention on this, even when they know that  i am leaving their service and will not use their app anymore, they STILL HELP YOU.

I am quite lucky to chat with one of their support team - her name is Regina and she's the representative of the word ""BEST SUPPORT"".

never say no to you, always find a way to help you as fast as she can.

thank you so much for being such a great support! love your app, love your team and don't be like ""RE_H_RG_D"" . u can guess who LOL"	409
41	5	2019-08-19T00:00:00Z	Just downloaded the app and we are loving it so far! Very easy to set up and any questions we have are answered in real-time through the Help chat feature. Regina at the help desk is awesome! Highly recommend this app to add a new consistent revenue stream to our online business.	410
42	5	2019-08-19T00:00:00Z	We are still setting up this app, ran into some update issues with our theme. Sarah (Rajni) was ON POINT!  took my chat, required a screen shot, and had my fix in place in under 10 min.   Thanks so much.	411
42	4	2019-08-15T00:00:00Z	This is good, but lacks some functionality that I would ideally like. There is no inventory management for subscription box content, so I am having to manage this on a spreadsheet for example. It means a lot of things can't be automated. The customer support is very good on the live chat which is great.	412
42	5	2019-08-12T00:00:00Z	I had a lot of trouble setting up our subscription box trying out numerous apps. BOLD's customer service team was very helpful and easy to chat with every time I had a question. Cody was awesome and super duper helpful!!!!	413
42	5	2019-08-12T00:00:00Z	"I have used this app I like this app. and using on multiple shopify store. its very helpfull for subscription functionality  
Good Assist by ""Harpreet and Rajni """	414
42	4	2019-08-10T00:00:00Z	Kaiser assisted me via chat with several questions I had. He was also willing to hop on a quick call which was nice. Still in the testing phase of using the app, but very good customer service.	415
42	2	2019-08-07T00:00:00Z	"Disappointed! Their service was good and the app is decent and all seems to work. However, you will most likely need them to install it as it happened to me, the automatic seems not to work properly.

What really disappointed me about this app though was this:

THEY DO NOT FOLLOW the settings of your payment processor. I have it to ""authorize"" an order and not ""capture"" because I want to make sure and double check my product is in stock before the payment is actually processed.

This is important because you will also avoid refund fees from your processor if you simply authorize and then when you are sure, you capture. 

However, ""bold"" captures the payment and does not follow my merchant processor settings within shopify. As such, I have to void the order from my processor and then I am left with a paid order within shopify.

It just messes everything up. Then, I have to manually cancel the customer subscription too.

Very disappointed."	416
42	5	2019-08-06T00:00:00Z	"The team is amazing!
They responded to me very quickly and accurately and I am very impressed with their customer service.
Thanks!"	417
42	5	2019-08-05T00:00:00Z	The team is responsive and quick! We needed a re-install after updating our theme and they were on the job and able to accommodate a small display request with all the work done 1 business day later. Thank you, Taylor!	418
42	5	2020-03-05T00:00:00Z	"Update to 5 Star review: 3-5-20
Mayank was super helpful in answering my questions and getting down to solving my problem. Another great customer experience! I have nothing but good things to say about Bold Subscriptions! Try it- you will not regret it!!!
Another Update to my original Review: 11-16-19
Seriously you all at Bold never cease to amaze! Your customer support gets 10 stars from me. I have had a couple issues -mistakes done by me mostly- and each representative has walked me through it so easily and effortlessly! This time Mélanie helped me out. She walked me through it step by step and gave me a ton of helpful info for future reference. Thank you, Mélanie for your amazing and fast work on getting everything sorted out in my shop! You were a life saver!
Update to my original Review:
Still 5 stars! I just spoke to Regina via chat and she was a major help to me. She was patient and went above and beyond. I ma thinking this is a requirement to work at Bold Commerce. :) I am still in the trial period but customer service and help as been WOW! I am super impressed! Thanks so much Regina- you were awesome!
Original Review:
So far I am still in the trial period and testing the app out to see if it will provide me with what I need for my shop. I have liked the features thus far, but today I got stuck and didn't know what to do. So I contacted them via their chat on their website and spoke to Kaiser. Well let me tell you, if you are lucky enough to get Kaiser on the other end of your chat- you are golden! When I asked questions, Kaiser tested out the answers first to make sure they actually worked correctly and then told me what I needed to do. To me that is going above and beyond in the customer service world. Thank you so much Kaiser for all your help and knowledge! You are amazing!"	419
42	5	2019-07-30T00:00:00Z	Super excited to find this solution! So far, so good and great customer support. Thanks team and Taylor!	420
43	5	2019-07-30T00:00:00Z	We use this app to manage our recurring subscriptions and are very happy with it. I received an error message when I deleted a product off of my store and contacted support through the Live Chat option. I worked with Challi and she walked me through the process using screenshots and logging in to my store herself and  helped me fix the problem quickly! Thanks Challi!	421
43	5	2019-07-27T00:00:00Z	Got help from Kaiser - he helped me from A to Z and was very patient with my hundreds of questions.	422
43	5	2019-07-26T00:00:00Z	If you are thinking of downloading any other subscription app other than bold DONT. The bold app is so easy to use and has so many impressive features for your customers to control and manage their subscription. Customer support has been amazing (ESPECIALLY Rajni!), they get back to you same day and even offer custom code  installation. This app is great	423
43	5	2019-07-24T00:00:00Z	Not very tech savy so when I needed help with figuring out what was going on with my cart I spoke to the representative named Simran and was taken care of very quickly!	424
43	5	2019-07-20T00:00:00Z	Quick and reliable customer service!! I messaged with a customer service representative named Kaiser, and I was able to get my problem resolved quickly and efficiently. 10/10!! 5 stars!! He deserves a raise!	425
43	5	2019-07-19T00:00:00Z	I downloaded this app to help me provide monthly subscription boxes to my customers. So far it is very user friendly and helped me accomplish exactly what I want. I had a few questions about the process and I reached out to Simran via live chat. He was AMAZING with clarifying what I needed/missed. Super happy with my experience with Simran and the app overall!	426
43	5	2019-07-17T00:00:00Z	I installed this app and had a couple of minor teething problems.  I contacted the online chat and spoke to Rajni who was really helpful and solved both problems I had within a few minutes.   Really quick to get help too!  I was only waiting a minute!  Great app and I'm sure I will be fine now I know that help is at hand!	427
43	5	2019-07-22T00:00:00Z	I'm a happy customer!! Extremely satisfied with how they have handled all of my issues and concerns. Looking forward to building a strong business relationship.	428
43	5	2019-07-17T00:00:00Z	Great app for subscriptions. Customer service is also quick to help out with any issues or questions. Rajni was quick to respond and help with installation.	429
43	5	2019-07-17T00:00:00Z	Melody and Rebecca really helped me out with an issue - good app and they are serious about supporting their customers!	430
44	5	2019-07-15T00:00:00Z	Asked for helped and they delivered. Thank you. Will continue to use Bold apps. They work great and are overall easy to use.	431
44	5	2019-07-11T00:00:00Z	I am loving the customer service for the bold application. I have been working with Taylor and he is fantastic. I wish all my support tickets we so pleasant nd helpful.	432
44	1	2019-07-10T00:00:00Z	"FALSE/MISLEADING ADVERTISING!!! 
They advertise subscription boxes all over their front page and even in the title of the app, and yet you have to pay for the advanced level to access the major feature advertised. I would understand if they charged a slightly higher amount but an extra $170 USD (6 times more than base)  for the feature marketed in the title is predatory and most would consider this to be misleading advertising.  

On top of all this, they add their own transaction fee. This would be fine if they didn't charge you the ludicrous $200 a month. 

I will fully admit their application has good functionality but the prices charged are not sustainable for a small business."	433
44	5	2019-07-10T00:00:00Z	Rajni was very quick to help me out with a customer update and gave me quick tips for the future.  I appreciate how helpful he was in making sure we were taken care of.  Thanks Rajni!	434
44	5	2019-07-08T00:00:00Z	"If you are looking for a subscription app you found it!
 Alexa helped me from start to finish to install and customize the subscription button. She was super responsive and made the installation process fast and easy!"	435
44	5	2019-07-08T00:00:00Z	Great app. Support was super helpful getting us set up from the beginning. Ran into a little hiccup and Rajni and Harpreet were super quick and helpful to troubleshoot and resolve.	436
44	5	2019-07-04T00:00:00Z	I used this app to create a recurring membership from anywhere on my page. Harpreet and Sukh were really helpful in the process of making my store and integrating with Bold	437
44	5	2019-07-03T00:00:00Z	This app let me see the future income of my business and allow me to see future trends. Excellent costumer support by Rajni	438
44	5	2019-07-03T00:00:00Z	The support team was great; very quick to address the issue I encountered. As a new user, my biggest takeaway...if in doubt, send in a help request! They'll fix it!	439
44	5	2019-07-03T00:00:00Z	Bold Subscriptions is easy to use and has been a great way to increase our sales. Highly recommended!	440
45	5	2019-11-28T00:00:00Z	I have contacted Bold support many times and Cody by far has been the most helpful! He answered both of my questions quickly and efficiently. This app is awesome too! We've been using it for a couple of months and no other app compares.	441
45	5	2019-07-03T00:00:00Z	I've set up a custom integration on our site and the documentation is clear and helpful. The customer support is A1 and our users' migration has been done easily.	442
45	5	2019-07-02T00:00:00Z	Great app and great customer service. Rajni was a great help when I needed it! I had a quick question about editing a customer's subscription and was able to get an answer within minutes. Thank you very much Rajni.	443
45	5	2019-06-29T00:00:00Z	Great app. Great customer service. Instant impact for us. A bit overwhelming to set up, but worth it.	444
45	5	2019-06-28T00:00:00Z	"I had the pleasure of having my first experience with Bold Subscriptions yesterday and I can't say enough about how thrilled I am that I was able to get such professional and fast service!  ⭐Brenda⭐ took the ball and not only did she not drop it, she ran with it.  A real Quarterback.  Thank you, Brenda and thank you Bold. 

SLOL Official"	445
45	5	2019-06-27T00:00:00Z	Rajni helped me out and was friendly and helpful! The support is great on this app. The app is highly customizable and I've gotten quick  support on multiple occasions.	446
45	5	2019-06-26T00:00:00Z	I've had to update my theme and the Bold Subscriptions support team did a fantastic job helping us migrate. Both Cody and Clifford were extremely helpful and responded to our needs very quickly. Thanks guys!	447
45	5	2019-06-25T00:00:00Z	Nikki was super quick to hop on the support chat and such an unexpectedly awesome and fun person to talk to. Oh, and she solved my problem easily and was patient with the fact that my tech savvy-ness is more than a little sub par.	448
45	5	2020-01-17T00:00:00Z	Love the app; makes it super easy to offer subscriptions to customers and integrates with the other apps we use to run our store. Also great customer service; Simran answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly! Daniel is especially help too!	449
45	4	2019-06-21T00:00:00Z	Rebecca was so helpful and patient with me. Had a ton of questions and she tackled them one by one.	450
46	5	2019-06-20T00:00:00Z	Harpreet and Lurii provided amazing customer service. They responded very quickly to communication and found the best resolution for our store.	451
46	5	2019-06-20T00:00:00Z	Rebecca was very helpful and made the process very simple for me. Great, quick customer service! I would recommend this app	452
46	5	2019-06-20T00:00:00Z	BOLD always provides amazing customer service. We always can count on them responding immediately and resolving our issue quickly. Today Melody did a great job fixing our problem!	453
46	5	2019-06-18T00:00:00Z	I worked with Cody and Ashley and very happy with their help. Bold support team is very professional and responsive!	454
46	1	2019-06-18T00:00:00Z	Words cannot simply describe the poor service we have received from Bold. An experience like no other.	455
46	5	2019-06-14T00:00:00Z	Tank you Taylor C. for your swift help!  Great Job! Taylor helped reinstalled my Bold recurring subscription app on my new theme.	456
46	5	2019-06-14T00:00:00Z	"awesome prompt customer service,  sarah was very helpful and made my experience awesome.
Very happy to recommend"	457
46	5	2019-06-14T00:00:00Z	Just installed this app after trying one of their competitors. Very happy with the functionality and the support given. I much prefer all the features available with this app. Oli was fantastic and guided me through the setup process. Highly recommend.	458
46	5	2019-06-14T00:00:00Z	Cody & Harpreet helped me out within minutes of the request. Was having issues with the app not appearing on one of my pages and they fixed up the code immediately. Also got them to help tweak some text that was showing up weird on the template. THANK YOU!	459
46	5	2019-06-13T00:00:00Z	"After spending 4 days with Klaviyo support I decided to contact BOLD to see if they could help with the technical issue I was facing with trying to have BOLD, Shopify & Klaviyo communicate. 

Simran went above and beyond to have one of their app experts call me and within 15 minutes Harpreet had solved the problem! Great service on this one guys - well done. 

All that said though, the app overall does have it's limitations and is quite expensive."	460
47	5	2019-06-12T00:00:00Z	Cody Scheler was great with helping us get set up with our site. He and his team helped us with some slightly custom features that we needed to work. Thank you so much!	461
47	5	2019-06-11T00:00:00Z	Easy to use subscription app backed up by great support - Jennifer (SuperJen!) resolved my query very quickly.	462
47	5	2019-06-11T00:00:00Z	Jennifer was great in helping me understand the different bold apps. In my case,  I needed another app besides the recurring monthly app in order to apply a Buy/Get discount for my customers	463
47	5	2019-06-10T00:00:00Z	Jennifer was awesome and extremely patient helping with a huge issue. So glad I was able to reach her!	464
47	5	2019-06-10T00:00:00Z	5 STARS for Cody Scheler!!! He was extremely helpful in making some edits to my display settings! Bold Commerce always goes above and beyond with their customer service, which is why I highly recommend using this app for recurring orders and subscription-based models!	465
47	5	2019-06-07T00:00:00Z	Just installed the app so we haven't gone live with it yet. I received excellent support service during the installation process, and Nick even helped me by styling the widget to best fit the style of my shop.	466
47	5	2020-01-02T00:00:00Z	WOW wow WOW. Ankur and Laurel have gone above and beyond ten fold in helping me customize this app to my needs. I can't say enough as to how appreciative we are of everything you have done for us. You didn't have to spend hours on this over mulitple days like you have and I simply want to say thank you for going the extra 100 miles.	467
47	4	2019-06-05T00:00:00Z	We had a little hiccup at the beginning of the implementation but the team worked swiftly to correct it. So far so good.	468
47	5	2019-05-28T00:00:00Z	I just install the app on my website, after couple days I installed the app, Snigdha help me with all that I asked her to install the app on my site, she took care of my case very carefull and now I have a stuning website thank to Bold and they customer service. Now let´s see how it works!	469
47	5	2019-05-28T00:00:00Z	Using Bold recurring is a lot easier to use than I expected! Very impressed with the support from Jennifer, Nick, Cody and Sarah. I've had a few little issues I haven't been able to solve and they've all been very helpful. Only thing is, being in Australia it means the live chat times are while I'm asleep. Be great if there were some more global support times.	470
48	1	2019-05-28T00:00:00Z	Having the client not be able to update their address and they nor I have the ability to push their ship date to today before the actual ship time also creates  an issue.	471
48	5	2019-05-23T00:00:00Z	Harpeet Khatkar was very helpful. He answered all my questioned. This is only app company on earth has phone support. They make my life so much easier. Thank you for an amazing service :) Christina	472
48	5	2019-05-20T00:00:00Z	I've used the app for a few months now and it has been so simple to use! The customer service is great as well!	473
48	1	2019-05-19T00:00:00Z	There is no clear way to cancel the subscription. It seems that you are unallowed. Helo me admin. I want to get out	474
48	4	2019-05-17T00:00:00Z	So far support has been great.  I have had issues installing on my outdated theme, but Bold rectified it in a few days.  Be careful making big changes over a weekend, the support seems minimal.  I am not yet fully configured, but it appears as if it will work great for my subscriptions.	475
48	5	2019-05-16T00:00:00Z	This app is great. We use it for our subscribing customers and it's a life saver. Both Harpreet and Harpreet Kaur really helped me with some problems I was having and they were quick to respond. Very grateful!	476
48	5	2019-05-16T00:00:00Z	Cody with Bold has been a huge help. We've had a few hiccups but he gather's the troops and gets things back in working order quickly. Solid customer service (most of the time) and allows us to effectively run our subscription box company.	477
48	5	2019-06-11T00:00:00Z	"Props to Jade and Lucas for helping so much with the install. 

Detailed instructions via email and answered my many questions. 

Adding Oli into the mix - spent an hour on the phone with me to answer my questions, and also their chat support is great!! Loving it so far."	478
48	5	2019-05-12T00:00:00Z	Loving the app, it's working great for our greeting card service! And amazed by the fast and helpful service post-purchase from the BOLD team. Thank you!	479
48	5	2019-05-09T00:00:00Z	Sean was amazing helping us get set up.  He made the process and transition so easy from our other website.  I appreciate his help and look forward to working with Bold.	480
49	4	2019-05-07T00:00:00Z	I had a few issues getting the widget to work correctly, but Arvinder was really helpful and fixed the issues quickly for me. We love the app :) Thanks	481
49	5	2019-05-07T00:00:00Z	I was struggling to figure out the code.  I put in for help and they did it all for me!  Amazing!  So easy.	482
49	5	2019-05-08T00:00:00Z	I initially had some difficulty with this app, due to it seeming to break after being tested. I did reach out and although the help was very good, it didn't get to the bottom of the problem. However, after leaving a review, Cody. S reached out to me and looked into the problem, which was likely code from another installed app. This was a prompt and proactive reaction, which a company like ours appreciates, and we were given advice on how to stop this happening again. I would recommend using Bold to install the app, just to use of their experience. Thanks Cody!	483
49	5	2019-05-06T00:00:00Z	Best app! supper fast and good customer service. answered all of my questions, would recommend to anyone	484
49	5	2019-05-06T00:00:00Z	We had some really specific update requests and reached out to the Bold developers for customization. It took a little longer to figure out than we expected but in the end, Cody and James got it sorted out. I've worked with this app on a few sites now, and will continue to recommend it, in part because of the great support staff who comes with it.	485
49	1	2019-05-06T00:00:00Z	Gave their developer access but never login to check and fix the issue. Significant issues were found in the checkout and we cannot keep waiting and we have to push back our website going live because of their unprofessional behaviour.	486
49	1	2019-05-04T00:00:00Z	"I've literally been transferred by about 4 developers here and every time something is fixed, something else comes up. All they do is apologize and don't really look into it fully. Now for my 3, 6 and 12-Month Subscriptions, I have a random ""Prepay for your subscription"" in the widget THAT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE and it's adding to a RIDICULOUS amount, only confusing my customers and preventing them from ordering a subscription on my store. 

Not only that, because of the previous rep's mistake, my new subscriber's subscription ends after her third month because he had checked/unchecked the wrong thing prior to receiving her order.

What's going on, guys?! Maybe this review and rating will give me some urgency and some correctedness would be nice for once.

Not so ""bold"" after all..."	487
49	5	2019-04-30T00:00:00Z	Great app that I use all of the time! Challi has been great at assisting in support when we need it. Highly recommend!	488
49	5	2019-04-30T00:00:00Z	Re-occurring orders are key, and Bold is a good app to mange this system. Whenever I have difficulty the help chat function seems to be a way to trouble shoot and Jennifer has been helpful.	489
49	5	2019-04-29T00:00:00Z	I love shopify, and am most happy with the customer service! Aman was awesome, and a huge help. Reference # 449494	490
50	5	2019-04-26T00:00:00Z	Easy to install worked perfect out the box! Just what we were looking for and support is first class, Thanks Again !	491
50	1	2019-04-25T00:00:00Z	I want to write this review about bold as a company and how unprofessional they are. They charged me numerous times for product that does not work. All of their programs slow down your store that customers drop out. Their customer service is awful. They used my account as test platform. I allowed them, but it was invasive and for several weeks they were making modifications, using my account as test platform. This was so unprofessional. At the end I ended up canceling all their services, because nothing was ever fixed. There was no refund and nothing was ever appreciated! Stay as far away from this company.	492
50	5	2020-02-05T00:00:00Z	Melody and Samantha have been super helpful in helping me customize my recurring orders app. Thanks so much guys for the help!	493
50	5	2019-04-25T00:00:00Z	Very responsive and fast customer support! Sean did a great job installing the app to my custom Shopify theme. I'm really happy with this app so far.	494
50	5	2019-04-23T00:00:00Z	We've had this feature on our site for quite some time. While I did not choose it, I've really enjoyed using it. I find Bold to be quite flexible and easy to use. I especially like the dashboard and analytics. They've improved their customer support with chat technology and I recently had a problem solved by a nice guy named Simran.  If you want to add subscription functionality to your website, you can't go wrong with Bold!	495
50	4	2019-04-22T00:00:00Z	Rushi was extremely engaged and helpful to me with troubleshooting and finding answers to my problems!  Most importantly, he was patient and nice without seeming like an automated robot.  Great job :)!	496
50	5	2019-04-19T00:00:00Z	I just installed the app on my site and really appreciate Brenden's support. Excited to see it live!	497
50	5	2019-04-16T00:00:00Z	"I chose this app because of the reviews about customer service. The service I received was fantastic 
Ankur was very helpful and patient with all my questions."	498
50	1	2019-05-02T00:00:00Z	Have been experiencing multiple issues with customers trying to update their CC information. This issue has been ongoing for 10 days. During our migration from another app, everything was great and unfortunately has taken a turn for the worse. Issues after issues, tickets after tickets. Will change this review once it's working correctly.	499
50	5	2019-04-15T00:00:00Z	Not sure about the app yet since we haven't launched, however the support in helping is set up has been wonderful. Cody has been great and answered all our questions in a more than reasonable time. Thanks for everything!	500
51	1	2019-04-11T00:00:00Z	I have been having a load of trouble getting bold to recognize subscriptions properly.  There have been a number of attempts to 'fix' this over the past several months but they have all been ineffectual.  During that time I have 'lost' numerous would be subscribers because of the app failing.  This is going to be my last attempt before switching back to my prior provider.	501
51	5	2020-02-24T00:00:00Z	Great customer support through their little Zendesk chat widget with Carter and Kelsey. Very reassuring :) Great app too! Works quite smoothly.	502
51	5	2019-04-10T00:00:00Z	I like how easy it is to set up, and I have only had the best customer service at bold. They will do a lot to help!	503
51	5	2019-04-10T00:00:00Z	The Bold app is great. There is a learning curve to using third-party apps with Shopify - it can be clunky territory regarding refunds, notification emails, etc. The customer service team is excellent and patient. I spoke with Alora today and she helped me solve a complicated issue. Glad we went with them for recurring orders.	504
51	3	2019-04-07T00:00:00Z	"It's a hit and miss with Bold. This app is one of those, and I will happily change apps when I find a better alternative. 
Main issues: Don't receive email notifications, and I can see other reviews complaining of the same thing, so obviously Bold trying to shift the blame onto 2 different email providers is rubbish. 
No pause function, which is very misleading as they promote this feature on the app description and even have it as the default text on the subscription widget. So, pretty embarrassing when you advertise this to your customer and then find out it's not even a feature."	505
51	5	2019-04-06T00:00:00Z	An excellent App, with an excellent support team! They made several customizations for me within just a couple of days.	506
51	5	2019-04-04T00:00:00Z	The support team are great and the app does really well. Nice interface and pretty easy to manage. It works	507
51	5	2020-03-05T00:00:00Z	Customer service is GREAT and always so friendly! I use a few Bold apps including their Cashier and Subscription apps. I've talked with Carter, Rebecca, Cody, Priyanka, and Laurel and they're all so quick to help whenever an issue comes up! There are a few features I wish I could have like being able to swap products more easily, but Bold is by far the best app for custom products/subscriptions on Shopify. Thanks Bold!	508
51	4	2019-04-04T00:00:00Z	Very impressed with the Customer Service and Support from the Bold team. Having the app set up and operational, I had some remarks an suggestions regarding some of the UI, Visibility and Usability and the support team (Mel) was very quick to agree, correct and provide resolution for an overall better experience for the user on the APP. Hats off and well appreciated!	509
51	5	2019-04-04T00:00:00Z	Great Challi helped with everything I needed online they are very nice and the app works well, it has  some glithces but it is gresat	510
52	5	2019-03-28T00:00:00Z	Been with BOLD Subscriptions for almost 2 years now, very few issues and if I ever had an issue, it got resolved quickly. The most recent download, I got their CASHIER app...had an issue with cashier and getting previous subscriptions integrated after initial setup. I brought the issue up to the BOLD support team, specifically Kyle and Scott, and they really went above and beyond to get this probelm solved, which included constant updates between them, their developers, and myself. Apprecaite the solid support everyone! BOLD works great for my subscriptions and also the one page checkout I was looking for. Thanks.	511
52	4	2019-03-27T00:00:00Z	Some limitations to the functionality of the app but awesome customer service. I've talked to several agents, all of which have gone out of their way to help me out and make it easier to use the app.	512
52	3	2019-03-25T00:00:00Z	"this app is what we need but the big problem  coming from your Payment Gateways!!!!!
why we can not add other PSP than braintree and stripe????
find us a solution
thank you"	513
52	5	2019-03-25T00:00:00Z	"Great app love it! Very good family of apps. we are in pre launch stage so excited to see it in production
Harpreet is amazingly helpful."	514
52	5	2019-03-23T00:00:00Z	App has met all of my needs and been a much more flexible and streamlined option to what I was previously using for my subscription box business. This app is going to allow me to offer customization that my customers have been looking for. Most importantly though is the support and customer service that I have received from everyone on the team at Bold. Keep up the great work guys!	515
52	2	2019-03-21T00:00:00Z	"1 Star because the app basically works, and another star because they have a live chat where someone answers ... BUT, it has tons of useless restrictions. Lots of little things that are easily added, but they keep funneling you to their developer requests page so they can quote you and make you pay for a feature that honestly should 100% be included, specially for the price tag.

They bill $200 a month plus 1% on transactions, which from this store is at least an additional $140+ a month in fees. Yet, you can't do simple things like the below.

- no more than 1 custom shipping option. Why even limit it to one custom option ?!
- you can't exclude shopify shipping options. That's a tick of button feature that's needed.
- for standard subscriptions, you can't track what day of the week they pay in order details within shopify. If you want notes or special tags for separate subscriptions, you're screwed.
- for build-a-box, you can't simply switch boxes within the same subscription. Your clients have to work it hard to cancel one subscription, place another order and then that works. NO Customer, wants to work this hard.
- we had to build out separate standard subscriptions just so we can control what day of the week orders process when within the same week.
- AND most important of all, ifs you run adwords, you CAN NOT track sales without requesting something custom from a partner or developer of theirs. MORE Money for something so basic.

Because they control all the pages used during checkout, you're cut at the knees to make it reflect well for your business. There are a lot more issues that are so basic, but they seem to be more inclined to be greedy for these features to be added, than be happy with the hundreds of dollars they bill you every month just for using an app that has been the same for a couple years. Try other apps before you are stuck with Bold. They should realize that a happy customer who's store can scale and have access to other simple settings will stay longer and pay those hundreds of dollars a month for longer. Instead, they want you to pay more or leave. Greedy."	516
52	5	2019-03-20T00:00:00Z	Challi was very helpful together when we switched to a new store on Shopify.  We've been using Bold Recurring and Bold Cashier for a few months now - super easy with minor set up issues that were quickly resolved.	517
52	5	2019-03-20T00:00:00Z	"Rifat was a consummate professional, attentive and patient with my inquiry. This service was A++++ 

BOLD is the THE BEST!!!"	518
52	5	2019-03-20T00:00:00Z	This app is great! it works as it should and has all the features you need to run a subscription program.  Their customer service is exceptional as well.  I recently had a large task that required help from the Bold Team.  They were able to do what was needed by before the deadline and communicated well throughout the process.	519
52	5	2019-03-14T00:00:00Z	I LOVE Bold! And, the customer service is impeccable! Agent named Rushi was just awesome and helped someone who isn't awesome at computer stuff fix a huge issue! Very helpful! Definitely recommend! :)	520
53	5	2019-03-14T00:00:00Z	Had a small technical issue that I needed some navigation help and Harpreet was an amazing resource! Quick and concise. Great customer service.	521
53	5	2019-03-12T00:00:00Z	On a scale from 1-10 Harpreet is about a 16. So energetic and helpful to me as I was setting up my meal plans page. She was patient and geneuinely cares about making our business a success! Thank you!	522
53	5	2019-03-11T00:00:00Z	Just getting started with the trial but so far the app seems pretty cool and what I'm looking for in a subscription app. Customer service and tech support have been great too.	523
53	5	2019-03-06T00:00:00Z	Challi was very helpful during set-up and the whole team did a great job working through the install on a custom theme. Definitely recommend!	524
53	5	2019-03-06T00:00:00Z	Arvi is the best! Super helpful to make sure everything works as it should :) Thank you so much for going above and beyond for us!	525
53	5	2019-03-05T00:00:00Z	I have a subscription box business and Bold is the best app I have used. Very easy to use and provide all the features needed for my business. Customer service is impressive and knowledgable. The helped me with all my tickets in no time and always deliver the best solution possible. Highly recommended!!	526
53	5	2019-09-03T00:00:00Z	Kaiser was extremely helpful in fixing my issues.  Not only knowledgeable about what I was trying to describe, but was also fast.  Thank you!!!	527
53	5	2019-03-01T00:00:00Z	Great customer support experience! Jonnathan helped correct the problem in less than 10 minutes, thank you!	528
53	5	2019-02-27T00:00:00Z	Helpful staff. Thanks Grace for your support. The app is easy to use as well and nicely done. It can slow down the page loading time which is the only bad point I can see.	529
53	5	2019-02-26T00:00:00Z	I've never had an issue with this app that they couldn't fix, their support team are super reliable and the application saves time and money that small businesses simply cannot afford to spend, i definitely recommend checking out this application if you're interested in building boxes or subscriptions and also recommend that you look into mapping your products out carefully with their advice.	530
54	5	2019-02-25T00:00:00Z	About 15% of my business is subscriptions. I have appreciated Rushi and Melanie's recent support getting my needs met and customized.	531
54	5	2019-02-21T00:00:00Z	Awesome support!, I recently got in touch with Scott S. awesome guy and spuer friendly. Been using this app for 6 months now.	532
54	5	2019-02-20T00:00:00Z	The team at Bold know their stuff. For far too long, I was managing two Shopify carts with two different gateway merchants, using Bold Subscriptions for both carts. When it came time to consolidate and simply, the Bold team didn't blink. They guided me through all of the gnarly back end stuff to get my hard-earned customers into one cart, one merchant, and one Bold Sub app. Whew! Thank you, guys! You rock!	533
54	5	2019-02-15T00:00:00Z	The app is great! They are always super helpful when I have a question or just need some support. They made adding a subscription to our website easy. I plan to utilize many more of their apps soon.	534
54	5	2019-02-15T00:00:00Z	Ankur and Harpreet have been so helpful with support over the past few days, they helped figure out all of our coding and subscribing issues we were having with products that weren't reflecting. Bold's immediate support help is so appreciated, we couldn't have launched our subscription product line without them. Thank you!!	535
54	5	2019-02-13T00:00:00Z	We recently migrated from WooCommerce (Woo Subscriptions within Wordpress) to Shopify and we were searching for the best solution that could (1) help us migrate, and (2) allow us to grow our business. The Bold team crushed it. They made sure the migration was seamless with 100+ customers and we're off and running within our new Shopify store. We're very thankful for the Bold team and their support!	536
54	5	2019-02-13T00:00:00Z	Exactly what I needed to start doing recurring orders. Excellent customer service, although the response time could be a little bit better. Highly recommend this app.	537
54	1	2019-02-12T00:00:00Z	this app misses a lot of my subscriptions.  The customer service is 2/10.  Takes days to reply and gives excuses to not fix the problem occurring.	538
54	5	2019-02-09T00:00:00Z	Really helpful team and a fairly simple app to install. The app does everything I want and more, really impressed.	539
54	5	2019-02-08T00:00:00Z	Great product, easy to use with a lot of options for customization. My favorite part? Customer Service! Grace at customer service goes above and beyond to make sure everything works correctly and all questions are answered! Thank you so much Grace!	540
55	5	2019-02-07T00:00:00Z	"We can't say enough about the customer service! Cody was friendly and patient as he walked us through the install and took the time to explain in detail how the app works. It was so easy!
A wonderful experience!"	541
55	5	2019-02-07T00:00:00Z	Amazing app, amazing  support! Will be using other apps from bold. They have helped me with some small modifications to ensure the app looks on brand as well.	542
55	4	2019-02-06T00:00:00Z	We love the Bold Recurring orders app. The installation and setup was seamless.  Because of our ability to offer subscriptions, we have been able to increase our revenue and also better project our sales knowing what orders were pretty much locked in. My only recommendation for improvement would be to make the customer dashboard easier to find and manipulate. We spend a fair amount of time helping customers manage their subscriptions because they can't work it out on the front end.  The Bold support team has been great though!	543
55	5	2019-02-05T00:00:00Z	"I used the Bold app to set up my recurring subscription. I would like to thank the amazing bold gurus Harpreet, Rushi and Kyle for their amazing assistance while setting up my subscription. 
Their help was totally awesome. Very patient with me, and talked me through the process. So delighted with their excellent service."	544
55	5	2019-02-05T00:00:00Z	"I can't believe I just set up a full-on store with recurring billing and I'm ready to sell in just a few days. I come from a tech background and used to build everything from the ground up back then. What a time to be alive!

Also, they have great customer service, Sarah helped me when I was stuck (which was just once because my question was very specific). It's all live chat so I got my answer right away, did not have to do a ticket and wait 24 hours and all that crap. 

Excited to start making millions in revenue with you guys!"	545
55	5	2019-02-04T00:00:00Z	Well thought-out app that is always working on new features and improving user experience. This app will take you a long way if you plan correctly. Challi in support was very helpful.	546
55	5	2019-02-04T00:00:00Z	Nir was very helpful for me. I had a real difficulty in bring people from my old subscription product to my new - but he stuck with me till we knocked down all the obstacles and got it done. Very happy and would highly recommend!	547
55	5	2020-02-12T00:00:00Z	Carter was the most helpful and patient... we walked through several issues with grace and patience PLUS expert knowledge of the steps to help me. He is a great asset to BOLD	548
55	5	2019-02-01T00:00:00Z	I use the app to process my fitness workout monthly memberships and it has been amazing! I definitely recommend!	549
55	5	2020-01-28T00:00:00Z	"SukH was a HUGE help. Very fast and fixed the issue with no problem and also let me know what to do in the future.

Priyanka, was also a HUGE help!  Answered all my questions quickly and explained everything.  Made the whole process easy with no frustration.

Daniel was super helpful and answered my question very fast!

Samantha was great in answering my questions and solving my issues!!!"	550
56	5	2019-01-31T00:00:00Z	Harpreet was super helpful for changing free shipping to flat rate and editing the widgets. Thanks Harpreet!	551
56	5	2019-01-31T00:00:00Z	"I used this app for creating subscription. This is realy cool app. Also they have one of the best support. ""Nir"" help me a lot."	552
56	5	2019-01-30T00:00:00Z	We love this app.  We use it for recurring yarn subscriptions and makes our life so much easier.  Bold help is amazing too, they have been quick to respond and always helped fix any problems we might be having!  Highly recommend this app.!  Thanks Bold Subscriptions	553
56	5	2019-01-30T00:00:00Z	I was having a little issue getting my subscription configured correctly on my own.  I reached out to Bold support and got in touch with Cody!  He was a savior in helping me get this app set up to perfectly work with our site and for our subscription product.  Cody you are the best!!  Thank you.	554
56	5	2019-01-30T00:00:00Z	Very good customer service, Sarah was super nice and helped a lot. I had troubles with the CSS and not any more	555
56	5	2019-03-07T00:00:00Z	Ankur at customer support is the bomb.com Always helping quickly resolve issues and always teaching us step by step to prevent the same issues from happening again. Thank you BOLD!	556
56	5	2019-01-28T00:00:00Z	Bold has always been available for my needs. Nir was able to help answer my questions quickly and effectively. Bold does what it takes to help me with my customers.	557
56	5	2019-01-28T00:00:00Z	App is amazing, customer service is BEYOND incredible. So helpful. Jonnathan helped me on chat for over an hour and helped solve all of my problems. A+	558
56	5	2019-01-28T00:00:00Z	Nice app, very helpful ! Great customer service ! Jonathan was very polite, professional and helped me resolve my issue.	559
56	5	2019-01-25T00:00:00Z	Great app and amazing customer service. Had a tricky CSS problem that I couldn't figure out and their support was able to figure it out in minutes.	560
57	5	2020-01-10T00:00:00Z	"Excellent and immediate support to fix minor issues today from Priyanka and Clifford who were extremely helpful!  Subscription works amazingly, any issues were quickly assisted by the Bold team through their support tickets. Even little tedious adjustments were worked on quickly! Recently had a minor change in the way it was formatted and Cody was able to help out quick to get it to exactly what we want.
Awesome app!"	561
57	1	2019-01-20T00:00:00Z	"I installed this app one week ago. After installation I wanted to trial the app so I didn't make it live yet. However, my customers could not complete any purchases after I installed this app. Every time a customer went to click ""checkout"" it would go to a blank page that said ""Bad request"". So I uninstalled the application, which caused even more issues. Bold has embedded their code everywhere in the back end of my shopify theme code, which has caused my site to malfunction and caused my business a large amount of loss of sales. I immediately contacted Shopify, my theme code developer and Bold to assist. Bold did not assist to fix the code problem, I have not received a single call back from Bold, I have not received any updates from Bold. I have tried to email them to get an update and ask them to fix it but I'm stuck with a website that has their code written on the front end of the customer view site. I am not a coder, I have no coding experience which is why I pay for shopify, pay for the theme and pay for a Bold subscription to use their support. I installed Bold because of the reviews it has. However, my theme developer has told me Bold is notorious for doing this, I wish I had never installed Bold. It disturbs me that I only installed Bold for a trial and it has caused me and is still currently causing me loss of sales due to customers not being able to complete their purchases and due to Bold's code appearing on my websites shop front causing customers to click away as the site looks terrible as things are not running as they are meant. I am really disappointed and frustrated. I don't know what more to do. This is my livelihood and for an application that I haven't even made live to have that ability over my site is disturbing, especially that Bold has not taken the right measures in a timely manner to even fix their mistakes on my site. I'm really not happy with their products and I do not recommend them. I have requested compensation from Bold for my loss of sales which I have not received any response to."	562
57	5	2019-01-19T00:00:00Z	Great support team. Helped me with a lot of stuff and they take their time to answer. The only shopify app who does automatic recurring. Special thanks to RONY for the help,	563
57	5	2019-01-17T00:00:00Z	"Very easy to fix issues via support, very easy to use system, reccomended! 

Shoutout Alexa (bold commerce) for the help!"	564
57	5	2019-01-16T00:00:00Z	Requested their customer support team to manually edit my checkout page and they delivered very quickly. On top of their team, their app is top-notch! If you're still looking for subscription apps, look no more! This is the one for you.	565
57	2	2019-01-14T00:00:00Z	"TLDR: Their email system is not set up correctly. Contacted their devs about it numerous times, but they were incompetent and did not fix it. If you're concerned about subscription emails being delivered, I'd steer away from them. 

Specifically their SPF records were not set up correctly, and ASPF and ADKIM are unable to pass verification. As a result, subscription transaction emails often get flagged as spam or at a minimum have the ""via boldapps.net"" tag. We directed them to the appropriate docs to fix said issue, but they refused. If they cannot set up their email servers correctly, it leads me to question how they can run a subscription app. We are looking into switching to Recharge."	566
57	5	2019-09-27T00:00:00Z	Sukh was able to not only answer my question, but guide me through making the necessary modifications on my end. I am totally impressed and relieved that my problem was solved so easily. Thank you, Sukh!	567
57	5	2019-01-13T00:00:00Z	Awesome support!! I had a glitch in my app but they were prompt and so helpful! Highly recommend! The app has been working wonderfully for me and for my customers!	568
57	5	2019-01-10T00:00:00Z	Great app, amazing support! Every time we have a question or an issue Bold support is on top of it. Customer service at it's finest!	569
57	5	2019-01-09T00:00:00Z	Rony was an amazing help. Through all the trials and error i went though in just one day to launch my store, Rony made my day. Provided quick information and was patient with the entire process. Thanks again!	570
58	5	2019-01-09T00:00:00Z	Seamless setup.  Haven't connected to payment gateway but that will be easy as well.  Ashley on the customer support team helped me with a question - super fast response and an easy solution she directed me to with step by step instructions that worked!!! So far, so good!	571
58	5	2019-01-08T00:00:00Z	Support team's RONY has been great in assisting us! Truly patient in guiding me through, especially for Build-A-Box options.	572
58	5	2019-01-05T00:00:00Z	Incredibly powerful app! Let's you manage recurring orders seamlessly and their developers will help you install the app within 48hrs. Thanks so much Bold Apps team!	573
58	5	2019-01-04T00:00:00Z	The customer service is unparalleled and their attention to detail is refreshing. They continually try to improve their products and listen to their clients questions attentively. This is my third subscription billing platform and it's the best for the meal prep industry by far. They go above and beyond and have even made it a point to reach out to me during non-business hours just to make sure things are running smoothly with my business. Thanks!	574
58	5	2019-01-03T00:00:00Z	I Love the BOLD APP. Customer service! Grace was so quick to respond and answered all my questions:)	575
58	5	2019-01-03T00:00:00Z	I had an issue with my cart as I was testing my new ecommerce website.  I chatted with guru Nir from Bold.  He fixed my issue in a matter of minutes.  It works great now.  Thanks Nir!	576
58	5	2018-12-31T00:00:00Z	"The best recurring app on the shopify marketplace. 
Allways new features 
Thanks Bold Team
Great job!"	577
58	5	2018-12-30T00:00:00Z	It is a great app to have a sustained income. it is a very good app to have for your store to increase customer value.	578
58	5	2018-12-29T00:00:00Z	Going into it I thought that the mechanics behind setting up the subscription process would be one of the most difficult and labour-intensive parts of building my business. As I tried out several other subscription apps on the market I was getting disheartened when I tried to set up quarterly subscription options and each time something didn't work the way i needed it to. Luckily at this point I discovered Bold's Subscription App. Not only did it do 90% of the things I needed straight out of the box, but when I did have questions or needed something reconfigured the Bold team always answered my emails quickly and their developers fixed the issues promptly.	579
58	5	2018-12-29T00:00:00Z	Love this app! I am still in my trial period and already have 5 subscriptions! It's literally paying for itself! Exceptional customer service. I highly recommend it for sustained automatic income.	580
59	5	2018-12-27T00:00:00Z	The team at BOLD is fantastic. They go above and beyond the normal call of app duty to really make sure they are explaining things. Grace and Jevon have been life savers!	581
59	5	2018-12-23T00:00:00Z	"Our experience with Recurring Orders (a.k.a. Bold Subscriptions) has been great! So much power, so many features and highly customizable. A key part of our decision was how easy it is to use with Product Options and access to all the bold apps and wider integration possibilities.

Support has been amazing (thanks Arvinder!). We sent a steady stream of site integration questions specific to our store and theme and worked through all of them together.  Bold feels like a partner.

I highly recommend!"	582
59	5	2018-12-21T00:00:00Z	I've looked at a few different subscription options and Bold was the only one that allowed me to add a buy now button directly to my site. It's taken a bit of work to customize it to my exact needs but their customer support has been great.	583
59	5	2018-12-20T00:00:00Z	App was a little confusing at first but the customer service is amazing and Rony helped me get everything sorted! Works great and we have had some customers subscribe already.	584
59	5	2018-12-19T00:00:00Z	"We use this app to manage our Monthly Subscription Program, the Ribbon Lovers' Club. We had no prior experience for this business model and we were extremely satisfied for what the app could do for us and also the wonderful customer service we received. Leanne Lucas has been terrific, going beyond expectations even outside regular working hours when we experienced some issues.
 One thing we did not use very well , although it is available, is the capacity to totally customize all notifications to customers.
 I highly recommend this app. The pricing is very good too. 
We are always looking at Bold apps first when it is time to add a feature on our Shopify stores."	585
59	5	2018-12-19T00:00:00Z	Your representative Nir gave me great customer service today when I called for help. Great job, Nir.	586
59	5	2018-12-18T00:00:00Z	so far, the Bold app looks promising as a very good investment.  we have 14 subscribers to products so far in the first month, and expect more as we move forward! The app makes it easy for visitors to commit to get products regularly automatically, with a discount..	587
59	5	2018-12-17T00:00:00Z	"I am very new to this app but It caused my buttons to look a little off centered.  I got online with bold chat service and they fixed it right away. 
Thanks bold!
www.soireetea.com"	588
59	5	2018-12-14T00:00:00Z	Llevo como dos semanas tratando de que alguien entendiera lo que mi tienda necesitaba.  Finalmente Lucas me pudo explicar y añadir lo que tanto había pedido ybtratadonde explicar. Muchas gracias por la paciencia y el excelente servicio. No hubo una sola vez en la que escribiera y alguien no contestara. ME CONTESTARON SIEMPRE. Excelente servicio al cliente no importa si no sabemos muchos del asunto!!! Excelente!	589
59	5	2018-12-11T00:00:00Z	Had some doubts with Shipping rates on the app and Ronny was very helpful guiding me through out the process! Very helpful customer service	590
60	5	2018-12-10T00:00:00Z	Our Shopify store (safeguardian.com) needed a solution that included a one-time product purchase plus a required recurring service subscription with affiliate commission tracking. Not an easy criteria and we were told by many other apps that they could not do it. The Bold subscription app was the perfect solution. More importantly, their support in getting the app set-up properly and integrated fully with the other required apps was absolutely incredible. Right in the middle of the Christmas shopping season, they (shout out to Lucas) worked closely with us daily until every last tweek was in place and tested. The Bold Subscription app is a excellent choice to consider if you are selling non-product or product + recurring service.  Highly recommended!!!	591
60	5	2018-12-10T00:00:00Z	I am becoming Bolds biggest fan. I cannot say enough how great their support is. Every time we add a new Bold app they prove to me again that their support is unmatched. We currently have 5 different Bold apps installed and they are all great! Don't mess with other sub-par solutions just get Bold.	592
60	3	2018-12-07T00:00:00Z	"3.5 out of 5. 

Solid product, good customer service. 

However, we've had several issues with recurring orders not going through - even though it's setup correctly in the backend. Bold has had to manually make sure the orders recur, which is not good because it doesn't give us confidence that as we scale, this will be a reliable service. 

Additionally, they only allow credit cards for recurring payments: No paypal, No apple pay or any of the dozens of other payment methods that users come to expect. Issuing refunds and issuing discounts and managing everything has to be done via their app, and not shopify. So if you have products that are not recurring, it create duplicative work and gets confusing. 

At the end of the day this is a great option if you're just starting out and need to get a recurring revenue stream going. But, I'd hesitate to trust it if we're doing tens of thousands in MRR or ARR. That being said, if you get to that point it should be fairly trivial to build a robust system yourself anyway."	593
60	1	2018-12-07T00:00:00Z	This app has one job: Facilitate subscriptions. We launched our subscription service yesterday morning. Many customers were charged multiple times, some up to five. Many are justifiably furious at us. First Bold tried to blame the merchant account, then Shopify, and now they just won't call us back or email us. They have offered no solutions. Basically a shrug of the shoulders is what we've received. Complete joke.	594
60	5	2018-12-04T00:00:00Z	Cody for the win! really helpful and easy to talk to staff. much appriciated!   Lovey, just lovely !!	595
60	5	2018-12-01T00:00:00Z	I have been using Bold Subscriptions for over 2 years now and have had great success with them. The recurring orders works great for my business and is definitely worth the price. Also, the customer service is great! My only wish is that they would have an easy way to get phone support. Overall this app is amazing and my company wouldn't be where it is without Bold!	596
60	5	2018-11-29T00:00:00Z	Very intuitive app but what's even better is the phenomenal customer service I received from an individual named Cody. Cody answered all my questions in a matter of minutes and took the time to walk me through my issues step-by-step.	597
60	4	2018-11-28T00:00:00Z	We haven't launched yet, but the Bold app has been a great solution for our monthly subscription. The customer service through the chat feature has been really helpful to answer my answers quickly. Nir and Guri were able to help me change some styling on the page.	598
60	5	2019-12-05T00:00:00Z	I want to thank Camilla for her efficient research with her team and help to address my subscription question	599
60	5	2018-11-28T00:00:00Z	Super stoked with support at Bold. We have ran into a few styling and loading issues, Samuel got it all sorted out for us in just a few minutes. I highly recommend using the Bold for all your subscription needs.	600
61	5	2018-11-28T00:00:00Z	Customer service is great! Cody was a huge help with reinstalling our Bold apps when we switched themes!	601
61	5	2020-01-14T00:00:00Z	Very helpful customer service. The recurring app is a little hard at first, especially if you have limited knowledge on some things. but with cs working with you, it does make it easier. Adding to my review -Customer Service is outstanding, best out of any company i have worked with. they have a lot of patience & always solve the problems. thanks. Adding again - Have now tried several apps with BOLD Recurring, Some work, some haven't. But the BOLD support team is 2nd to none. They really are helpful & terrific and will do what they can to work through issues.	602
61	5	2018-11-26T00:00:00Z	I had a very good experience working with Bold support.  They are very fast and responsive to questions and helped us to transition. Thank you! 5 stars!	603
61	5	2018-11-26T00:00:00Z	Guri is the best!  Great response.  Great help.  Very easy to deal with!  So quick and efficient.  Thank you so much from penpaladventure.com	604
61	5	2018-11-26T00:00:00Z	We are still new to Bold Subscriptions and aren't completely sure what to advise our customers when they have an issue (user error on their part). We just had a customer receiving an invalid credentials error when they try to log into their account. I logged into Chat and Rony walked me through what to do for this guy. Now, thanks to Rony and BOLD, I'm able to answer my customers problem and they don't have to wait days for an answer! Thanks muchly Rony for making us look good!	605
61	5	2018-11-26T00:00:00Z	Samuel just helped me out on creating prepaid coffee subscriptions on my site just in time for the holiday season. I had been worried about customers being charged monthly, but with his help we are all good to go. Thanks again!	606
61	5	2018-11-26T00:00:00Z	Had such a great customer experience with Rony. He helped me out big time getting myself set up with the Bold Subscription app. Thank you! So so so appreciate it	607
61	5	2018-11-26T00:00:00Z	"Excellent app and awesome service. Leanne on the support team rang me in the UK (3 am Canadian time!) and talked me through some queries I had and answered all my questions perfectly.

Thank you!"	608
61	5	2018-11-24T00:00:00Z	App works well, though still getting used to it.  Lots of options and Bold support is there to help with any questions!!	609
61	5	2018-11-23T00:00:00Z	I am using Bold Recurring Orders to sell a monthly magazine subscription. I watched various YouTube videos from Bold that helped me set up the initial subscriptions, but was feeling stuck with a few small things I needed to edit to tailor my subscription to work for me. I spoke to somebody called Leanne on online chat who was really helpful, answered my (many questions), sorted out adding a bit of custom code for me and has put me in contact with somebody else who can customise the app a bit further to work for me. Excellent service - and on Black Friday evening too!	610
62	5	2018-11-23T00:00:00Z	Great app and superb customer service. Leanne from support is awesome! Fast, accurate and professional! Thank you again! I highly recommend this company and their people! :)	611
62	5	2018-11-28T00:00:00Z	"A great app that has provided us with the ability to take an initial payment and link this to a monthly service subscription. The team, specifically Grace - has been really helpful and given us such great support with setting this up. We had a lot of questions and requests to get it just right for our needs and she happily and patiently answered all of them. She even joined us on a hangout to talk things through and give us a walk through. Now the site is live and working great. Thanks so much Grace!! 

The only thing I would say is that we found out we cannot take some of the payment methods through the recurring payment checkout - Apple, Google and Shopify Pay. Also, we can't send abandoned checkout emails. We've been told this is in the roadmap though.

Thanks Bold!"	612
62	5	2018-11-23T00:00:00Z	Bold subscriptions is AWESOME and the team solidifies it! The thorough feedback and patience that their team exudes is an evident sign of how the true nature of their culture is. & did I mention how AMAZING Leanne is! Yep, just awesome!! Definitely a company that I would recommend for any start-up and large organization. Keep up the great work team!! You guys rock! ❤️  - Clarice, Lavish Slumbers	613
62	5	2020-03-03T00:00:00Z	"Update March 2020.  We still use this app, support is awesome.  Aryan Sharma was super helpful with my questions, provided support for me to read through!

We have been using this app for a couple years and it is great. The support team is also so helpful whenever we have questions about changing things. I reached out to live chat at 11:50 pm on Thanksgiving and got answers right away. GURI, LEANNE and MORGAN helped us figure out our issue so quickly! Bold, you rock!"	614
62	5	2018-11-21T00:00:00Z	The Subscription functionality is very easy to use and understand. And the customer support is absolutely 10/10 if you do need any help with anything - I had some small adjustments made to my store to tweak the styling which was dealt with quickly, professionally and expertly. Thank you Clifford and Victoria especially	615
62	5	2018-11-21T00:00:00Z	Very good support, Guri and Mel are great.  Subscriptions work without issue and customers are happy with their level of access to make modifications.	616
62	5	2018-11-20T00:00:00Z	"I have only had Bold for a day so far, and while I experienced a few speed bumps getting it set up, the customer service has been outstanding! Samuel and Morgan were both and incredibly helpful when it came to fixing the issues with my site, and it is now fully operational. 

I am excited to continue using Bold Recurring payments on my site, and can't thank Samuel and Morgan enough for all of their help and guidance."	617
62	5	2018-11-20T00:00:00Z	This app has been wonderful to help me grow my membership business.  I am especially appreciative of customer service who really works to solve me problems.  A special shout out to Arvinder who assisted in securing developer assistance for my most current request.	618
62	5	2018-11-20T00:00:00Z	Customer service is awesome, Cody really helped me figure out an issue with a subscription. Easy to follow along and it was clear he really cared about having all my questions answered. Thanks!	619
62	1	2018-11-17T00:00:00Z	"This app doesn't uninstall from your site/theme cleanly. Leaves a ton of code embedded and if you delete the remaining files from the ""snippets"" area it will break your site.  Piss poor would be my rating, a good developer wouldn't leave garbage from their app on your site if you wanted to remove it."	620
63	1	2018-11-15T00:00:00Z	Absolutely awful. An error with this app meant that my customers were charged again and again for no reason. Took ages to resolve. Meanwhile because of this my chargeback percentage went up to 10% for two months. Customer Service very slow to resolve with no definitive resolution, months in. Disasterous app.	621
63	5	2018-11-15T00:00:00Z	I have said this before but Bold Customer service is amazing. Shout out to Melanie for the latest help with the subscription software!	622
63	5	2018-11-14T00:00:00Z	Great app and great service, i needed the app to do something a bit different than what it’s made to do and they helped customize it to be as close as possible to what I wanted, love it	623
63	5	2018-11-14T00:00:00Z	"Great solution.  We started with Bold but then switched to Recharge thinking the solution had addressed a few issues with Bold but that was a mistake.  We had nothing but problems from the second we tried Recharge.
1) Recharge requires you create new items for each subscription so you have duplicate items.  Additionally, it only supports one subscription model, ie weekly, monthly or yearly.  Bold support all of the above.  Recharge is also not as integrated as it leads you to believe.  Much of the process and workflow is accomplished through the use of add-on landing pages, etc that have very limited theme features.
2) Lastly, the support was terrible.  They ask you to fill out a form for migration support.  We did so and no one got back to us and when they finally did, they just sent a set of instructions to follow.  Why waste someone's time having them complete a form if you are not going to help them migrate to the solution.

Needless to say, we came back to Bold and love it.  Very simple and easy to use and install with a lot of advanced features.  The one thing that Recharge does shine on is their customer login interface.  Definitely much nicer."	624
63	5	2018-11-13T00:00:00Z	We have used Bold from the start and are very pleased with how they handle our requirements as a subscription-only shop.  The customer service folks will always go that extra mile to help, but if you are really lucky you will get help from the customer guy above all customer guys ever walked on the surface of  internet - hes name is Jevon, and a funny fact is that all the 220 peoples working at Bold have to stand up and dance for one minute every time someone leaves a good review mentioning him. Thanks Jevon <3	625
63	5	2018-11-13T00:00:00Z	Great app to add subscriptions to your site. Had some issues and Lauren worked with me and got them all corrected. Very attentive to the customer. Excellent service and highly recommend it!	626
63	5	2018-11-13T00:00:00Z	Grace was extremely helpful in setting up our store when we had hiccups in the back-end. The support is amazing and you should totally check out this app if you want to create subscriptions for your store!	627
63	5	2018-11-08T00:00:00Z	"It's been a few months now and all I can think is that I wish I was using this app 3 years ago when we first launched! Customers have so much control and so do I as an admin. 

The only issue is that the discount provided by the app will stack if you offer a discount on the item for 1 time sale, but there are always workarounds. easy 5/5 still in my opinion.

Customer service has been on point too, from custom features to quick fixes when I bump into an issue."	628
63	5	2018-11-08T00:00:00Z	Lucas, Scott and Julian: Thanks for going the extra mile for me, you did an awesome job by not just answering my question, but _solving_ the problem which was not directly related to your application. I am very grateful for that, you are nothing but amazing!	629
63	5	2018-11-07T00:00:00Z	Sam and Nir provided excellent and prompt customer service to get all of my questions answered. it's a great app and I would absolutely recommend it.	630
64	5	2018-11-07T00:00:00Z	Quick live chate response and excellent assistance with switching products in a subscription and adding products to an order. Thank you Rony Guri! Now I know how to make those changes without breaking everything.	631
64	5	2018-11-06T00:00:00Z	Outstanding customer service - fast response time and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Makes using the app easy and accessible.	632
64	5	2018-11-06T00:00:00Z	Lucas and the team have been very helpful in fixing the issues I have had. I have a heavily editted theme and the code was getting confusing - each app just keep conflicting with each other, and they even fixed that! 5/5 Stars, kudos to the Tier 2 team!	633
64	5	2018-11-05T00:00:00Z	Had some quite complex code that I could not get correct, Guri helped me out in minutes, awesome, thanks, great job...	634
64	4	2018-11-01T00:00:00Z	The Bold Recurring Billing Team (especially Leanne and Sean!) were incredibly helpful as we migrated to Shopify from our old ecommerce platform. They worked with us every step of the way to migrate our existing recurring billing subscribers, and helped find solutions when we encountered issues switching payment gateways, and with inaccurate data from our previous recurring app.  They have continued to provide fast resolutions to issues as they arise, and are very open to feedback and suggestions.	635
64	5	2018-10-31T00:00:00Z	Works well and certainly increases revenue.  Great customer service.  Some unavoidable checkout limitations with Shopify which lead to extra work on discount codes and pricing changes not automatically updating.   Had a question about price changes today and Cody & Lucas were able to help on chat saving me lots of time.  Thanks guys!	636
64	5	2018-10-31T00:00:00Z	Has to be one of the best teams on the web. Even on a closed Holiday they helped us. Can't say enough good stuff about them.  Cody, Rifat, Grace, Eric, Nupar + Lucas (Hope I didn't miss anybody!) - YOU'RE FANTASTIC!	637
64	5	2018-10-31T00:00:00Z	"The subscriptions by BOLD is amazing. I was using another app for subscriptions, but BOLD allows you to do way more by way of customization and integration with your site.

Furthermore, the staff at BOLD is super helpful an always responded to my requests."	638
64	5	2018-10-30T00:00:00Z	This app does exactly what we want. The ability to create simple but powerful customer specified subscriptions. We've tried other options in WooCommerce, but we could never get it exactly the way we wanted without spending a lot of money on custom development. Our vision was always constrained, but with this app, we are able to do exactly what we wanted. To offer subscription based options to our customers in a very simple, visually driven way without needing to hire experts to configure the back end. Do yourself a favor and try this app. The fact that they offer such a generous free trial says a lot about their confidence in the product. The support team has also been top notch in terms of solutions and responsiveness.	639
64	5	2018-10-30T00:00:00Z	This is a review of my experience with Sean who helped me set up the APP - He is on the ball.  Knowledgeable, responsive and easy to work with.  Look forward to using this platform	640
65	5	2018-10-30T00:00:00Z	Great App! Excellent Support from support reps Rony and Jevon! Increasing our sales and making it easy to do!	641
65	5	2018-10-30T00:00:00Z	"Where do i start.. Well 1st let me say the app is great. Pretty simple to install and integrate, its very flexible and easy to use, its fast, it works very well and its driving reoccurring orders for my site.

But what I'm most impressed with is Bold'd freakin awesome customer support. On several occasions i was trying to make the app do something that it wasn't meant to do out of the box. When i struggled getting my experiments to work, Bold customer support stepped in and did the work for me, fast, correctly and free of charge. I was blown away.

Get this great app and the great customer support that comes with it!"	642
65	5	2018-10-29T00:00:00Z	Setup was easy and support (from Samuel L) was quick to answer my questions. I'm happy to be able to offer a product subscription option using a very reasonably-priced plugin. One of their closest competitors was over twice the price for no appreciable difference in functionality. I'm happy I went with Bold.	643
65	5	2018-10-29T00:00:00Z	Thank you Nir for your superior service!! Very quick and knowledgeable.  I appreciate your support!	644
65	5	2018-10-26T00:00:00Z	Love Bold and their family of products.  The only thing better than their products is the customer service.  Great company to partner with!	645
65	5	2018-10-26T00:00:00Z	"I'm implementing this tool to run my business. So far, the product is really interesting and you can find many ways to customize it.
The customer support is really good and very willing to help !

I really recommand it ."	646
65	1	2018-10-25T00:00:00Z	"TRASH. WAITED DAYS for them to even install it. Then issues within the App and trying to add Stripe, very glitchy and sketchy. Had to refill in a LONG info required section 5 TIMES. 
ALL TO FIND OUT, THE SUBSCRIPTION STILL DOESN'T EVEN SHOW UP ON THE PRODUCT.

THEN TO TRY TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT, AND NO RESPONSE NOR IS THEIR ""LIVE CHAT"" LIVE. ITS ALWAYS OFFLINE.

WASTE OF TIME, AND RUINING MY SET SCHEDULE RELEASE DATE. 
THANKS  A LOT BOLD!!!"	647
65	5	2018-10-24T00:00:00Z	We use the bold recurring subscription app. Huge game changer! This app has made my business functionally possible. Brenden and the rest of their customer service team are super helpful with any questions or tweaks we have needed to make to the app. Thank you!!	648
65	5	2018-10-24T00:00:00Z	We wanted to inquire about a feature on the app. Thanks so much to Nir, Kyle and Samuel for helping us out! Great customer support!	649
65	5	2018-10-24T00:00:00Z	Support team for these apps is amazing & very responsive. Received quick effective help from Guri and am now back on track. Loving this app!	650
66	5	2018-10-24T00:00:00Z	"Been with them for a few years now. The app has many features, but could run into problems here and there at times. Good that their support team has always been helpful (Jevon, Harpreet, Victoria) =)

66	1	2018-10-23T00:00:00Z	I set this app up to create subscriptions. I've used BOLD apps before and I know they are a pain and never display the way you want them to but thought I'd give it a try anyways. After getting everything set the way I wanted, I realized it had completely altered some other settings within my site - specifically within the cart. The product images were gone and replaced with hyperlinks. Product prices and totals were also gone. I deleted the app and spent the next hour fixing everything this app messed up. The app itself doesn't do what I want it to do and although it offers a 90 day trial, there is no way I'd pay the ridiculous price this app has after that trial. Its frustrating to use and set up. It's lacking features (as most Bold apps are). Just DON'T!	652
66	5	2018-10-23T00:00:00Z	I just switched over form another app, and I must say the customer service I received from Cody makes me glad I did. Bold seems to have support down pat.	653
66	4	2019-10-21T00:00:00Z	Dylan was very helpful and efficient! Answered my questions and took care of our issue. Great service!	654
66	5	2018-10-22T00:00:00Z	Although subscription boxes can be hard to integrate onto Shopify, Bold has met our needs the best. We have used Bold support center numerous times, and they have been very helpful, especially Rony and Melanie!	655
66	5	2018-10-19T00:00:00Z	"I was in urgent need of fixing something I couldn't find even after watching the tutorial. 
Charles and Nir saved my work today!!! They were helpful, diligent, and most importantly very quick. Thanks guys I appreciate your effort ;)"	656
66	5	2018-10-19T00:00:00Z	"App installation was seamless. Even if you're a newbie, you can do it. They have plenty of videos to help along the way. 

I had a small issue with some code showing up in my cart after subscription orders were added. I opened a support ticket and Grace quickly took control of the situation. It was escalated to Tier 2 support and resolved within a day.

Awesome customer support! Install the app. You won't be disappointed."	657
66	5	2018-10-18T00:00:00Z	We set up Bold Subscriptions to offer recurring orders for our consumable products. There was a small bug in the app when adding recurring items to cart causing HTML to show up in the cart. I got on the Bold support chat and Nir and Harpreet solved the problem with minutes. Very responsive and helpful customer support team, I'm looking forward to integrating more of the Bold apps on our site!	658
66	3	2018-10-18T00:00:00Z	This app probably works very well for a simple business that sells subscription boxes only. It is not as flexible as we need it to be for our business, which does a combination of subscription products and one time purchases. The reporting and analytics generated are insufficient to form business decisions - the data requires a lot of massaging - real reports would be a great bonus. The support has been very good. I don't know if it will suit our needs as we grow.	659
66	5	2018-10-17T00:00:00Z	Cody was a huge help, sorted my problem in 2 minutes and listed a ticket for developers to finish the task. Amazing support	660
67	5	2018-10-17T00:00:00Z	Thanks for Nir Brandon and Leanne, they gone through every step with me, and they also taught me how to set up the app step by step. Thanks again!!  They are the best!! :)	661
67	5	2018-10-17T00:00:00Z	I have been looking for an App that offers what Bold can.. So far I have been super impressed with their customer service.  I am looking forward to seeing how it works for us!!! : )	662
67	5	2018-10-17T00:00:00Z	"Nir was really helpful today, great service thank you. 
I needed to set the Bold app for my shopify store and I'm new to everything. 
Very patient with my questions."	663
67	5	2018-10-17T00:00:00Z	I use this app for recurring orders - memberships. It's easy for the customer to use on their end. Support is great too. Rony J has been super helpful over support chat!	664
67	5	2018-10-16T00:00:00Z	Best app for subscription and the customer service is amazing. Guri on bold team is superb he helped me in like 2 minutes for the problem i was struggling for last an hour or so. Will recommend this app.	665
67	5	2018-10-16T00:00:00Z	This app is the best, it has solved all my problems. The support from Guri was first class. Thank you.	666
67	5	2018-10-16T00:00:00Z	Great app and great support! Cody, and others, were extremely helpful and made sure all my questions were answered	667
67	5	2018-10-15T00:00:00Z	The service is great, available. Cody answers often and that's great !! thanks. I use the app for years and I appreciate the flexibility too	668
67	5	2018-10-14T00:00:00Z	Nick has gone above and beyond the level of 5 star ⭐️ customer service.  He changed the live code of the app to match my theme!  Very responsive!  Thanks Nick for all your help!  Your the fuc***g best!	669
67	5	2018-10-13T00:00:00Z	Had some issues with Rifat - was very helpful in helping through the 6 or 7 different questions I had asked him about.  App itself is decent, not the greatest, but i'm not sure if there's anything better.	670
68	5	2018-10-11T00:00:00Z	This app has excellent customer support.  Guri was able to quickly help me set up my payment gateway and make sense of how everything works.	671
68	5	2018-10-11T00:00:00Z	We were having issues setting up our new Bold Subscription service and Brysen helped me out ! He was a great help with everything . Really appreciate the great customer service you provide ! I enjoy the many options you have a customizing your layout  to match your website.	672
68	5	2018-10-10T00:00:00Z	"Merci aux services client : CODY qui est juste Excellent 
repide et serieux je recommande merci !!!!!"	673
68	5	2018-10-09T00:00:00Z	We just launched a very simple and straightforward subscription service and the Bold app is perfect for it.  It was simple to set up and start selling right away.  Over time, we will begin to use more of the features that the app offers but out of the starting gate we kept it simple.	674
68	5	2018-10-06T00:00:00Z	I own a baby food meal prep company and I recently downloaded this app to help implement a subscription model on my site....so far it is working quite well and it is exceeding all my expectations!  Any difficulty I experienced during setup was completely rectified with their awesome customer service team! I definitely recommend the Bold Subscription app!	675
68	1	2018-10-04T00:00:00Z	"Your support is responding to our request in a very unprofessional way and it is awful. Paul seems just want to get rid of the ticket by sending some vague instructions.

How can we get someone to actually help us with our request?"	676
68	5	2018-10-03T00:00:00Z	Guri and Arvinder were super helpful! Their support got me what I needed quick. Great app, it's worth it to spend time setting this up! The chat support feature is brialiant.	677
68	5	2018-10-03T00:00:00Z	Arvinder and Parminder helped me remove the secondary item from the product page using the CSS sheets that I wasnt familiar with.   Will help my conversions in the future.	678
68	5	2018-10-03T00:00:00Z	Love the app and cody from the team was very helpful. Taking my business to the next level with this app.	679
68	5	2018-10-02T00:00:00Z	I wanted to change the subscription wording and the chat service was fast shoutout to Cody for helping me and making my experience friendly it felt like we were friends :) overall i am really happy with bold subscription i have been using them for 1 year	680
69	5	2018-10-01T00:00:00Z	Have used the app for almost three years. Cody/Scott helped solve a technical glitch in minutes. Great app.	681
69	5	2018-10-01T00:00:00Z	I'm using this app to allow customers to subscribe to coffee. Bold is so easy to  work with! They easily and eagerly help me with all my problems and features!	682
69	5	2018-09-26T00:00:00Z	The app has been working fantastic, minus one issue I have had with it, but Cody and Evan were awesome and super responsive and helped resolve the issues I had!	683
69	5	2018-09-26T00:00:00Z	Customer service and support are excellent. Fast and very helpful. Most recent interaction was with Rose who is 5-star helpful.	684
69	5	2018-09-25T00:00:00Z	Absolutely top class support!  Iruii turned around an installation issue I had really quickly and Arvinder added some great new functionality to my website  www.wolfworthy.co.uk  I really couldn't be happier.	685
69	4	2018-09-25T00:00:00Z	"I just started using the Bold app for my subscriptions and so far it has worked great. I will say sometimes the customer service hasn't really been as helpful as I needed, they told me the app couldn't do something when in fact I found out it actually can. Knowing that would have saved me some headache. (Only reason they didn't get five stars). 

However, overall the app has been great so far. I recommend it."	686
69	5	2018-09-25T00:00:00Z	So far we love the Bold Subscription app. I was stuck on how to update a customer order and Guri was really helpful! My questions were answered right away with screenshots to make it clear! Great customer service!!	687
69	5	2018-09-24T00:00:00Z	I like so much this app because it help me with my module of subscriptions and i like so much the customer service with this account in especially with Guri, that he help me all the moment.	688
69	3	2018-09-24T00:00:00Z	Great app...when it works. We've had our one item used with this app that we want to sell pre-paid for a 1 year subscription revet to a regular product twice now. Because of this we have to email each customer who orders it with this error and have them reorder when the app is fixed. Keep an eye on your product listings when using this app.	689
69	5	2018-09-20T00:00:00Z	"So far it's been pretty easy to integrate into my shop. I haven't had a customer use it yet, but so far, it's been great. Thanks to Cody. Cody helped when I had an issue. Cody is great! Thanks Cody!!

My one suggestion: you should direct people after they download your app *right* into the step-by-step ""how to integrate into my webshop"" page. Once I found that page, it was a breeze, but before I found it, it was pretty daunting and seemed confusing."	690
70	5	2019-01-30T00:00:00Z	BOLD has made managing my regular subscriptions a breeze, and when I ran into problems, Cody and Nir from tech support walked me through the process like a pro and communicated my urgency to the team. Thanks for being so helpful!	691
70	5	2018-09-18T00:00:00Z	I love this app and their customer service is phenomenal! Super fast and patient when I don't understand the techy language. Cody assisted me today and was great!	692
70	5	2018-09-13T00:00:00Z	App is pretty seamless and support team is very responsive.. Guri was a tremendous help.	693
70	5	2019-07-03T00:00:00Z	"UPDATE: Thank you for the great service, Rajni!

We use Bold to power our kids subscription box company, and they have saved our asses more than once. We left another recurring orders app, and we are so glad we did because Bold has more customization options and the BEST customer service team. Brenden and Lucas are our heroes, and they make it possible for us to serve more families and get more books in more little hands. Love Bold!"	694
70	5	2018-09-11T00:00:00Z	"Love it!   Simply, love it!  Works great for what we need.  great customer support and onboarding.   Better, much better than Cratejoy! 

sudsysoapery.com 

We love the service Lucas and Cody gave us!   Great customer service!"	695
70	5	2020-04-02T00:00:00Z	Watched the Recurring orders webinar with Jay and JP. Then, this week, we modified our recurring orders app to expand our products and options for our customers. Alysha was assigned to us through our appointment scheduling at BOLD. Alysha was the absolute BEST fit for us in helping us get this done the right way. She is intelligent patient, kind, extremely knowledgeable in their product lines, helpful and her follow-through is impeccable. BOLD has some of the best technology and people working for them...don't hesitate, do it!	696
70	5	2018-09-04T00:00:00Z	Great app but even better support. Cody and Brenden from the support side are amazing. Thank you both !!	697
70	5	2018-09-04T00:00:00Z	"I've only just launched my store so can't comment on how well the app operates once in action... but what I can say is that the setup and way it works in the store is really impressive.
The customer support has also been first class. I've used a few different Bold apps (Upsell and Discounts apps) and the Bold customer service team has been excellent and really helpful getting my store setup just the way I want it.
I'll write another review in a few months time, hopefully when I have hundreds and thousands of customers using the shop! Thanks Bold team."	698
70	5	2018-09-03T00:00:00Z	"We really nervous about setting up a subscription model for our store but Bold has made our experience seamless! Jevon and Brysen have been incredibly helpful. Whenever we need help or have a question, they respond almost immediately. We love how easy it is to set up a phone meeting and get your questions and concerned handled in a very friendly way. We have yet to stump Brysen with a question.

We talked to other subscription management companies and we didn't get the same friendly vibes as we did with BOLD. So they were the easy choice. 
Thank you guys so much!"	699
70	5	2018-08-31T00:00:00Z	App works great with easy to follow installation steps. And support usually replies within 24 hours and even checks back on you as a reminder that you forgot to do your work! Cheers again Support Team!	700
71	5	2018-08-29T00:00:00Z	Great app. Great customer service.	701
71	5	2018-08-28T00:00:00Z	GURI  - was great quick to the point and friendly. Guri was knowledgeable in his directions and in guiding me through finding and fixing my recurring project and discount language needs, thanks Guri!	702
71	5	2018-08-28T00:00:00Z	"Since we sell daily necessities for women recurring orders app makes our clients life easier. Our app is a bit different from what Bolt originally offered, so with the help of Bold staff we had to make some changes in order to let our clients to be their own boss on the orders. Before we were having our store on different  platform with very complicated subscription. But now, with our new store Bold app made our life much easier. Easy for our clients and for us too. The admin part is so simple to understand, very easy to edit, if our clients asks, but they also can do everything from they account to. 
I am really happy with this app, it made our life much less complicated (or not complicated at all). 
The support team was sooooo excellent. They provided us with all needed changes (and we needed a lot) to accommodate our subscription vision, and they even didn't charge us for that. They made all client migration from our old store to the new one. It was the best customer experience, with experienced team of professionals."	703
71	5	2018-08-24T00:00:00Z	Been using Bold for over a year now. This app is GREAT! & Easy to use!!!  Plus Bold has consistently provided amazing customer service. THANK YOU!!!!	704
71	5	2018-08-17T00:00:00Z	"Have been using this App for over 1 year and very happy with it's functionality.

Bold even installed it on my original theme for free, and I have just moved to a new theme where the Bold Team were happy to install the App again for free, as well as answer and troubleshoot a few questions I had.

Highly recommend this App, will be using it for future projects as well."	705
71	5	2018-08-15T00:00:00Z	"I love this app. I am currently using this across 3 different websites. It's easy to run and manage our recurring monthly orders with our customers. What I love the most is the support they offer. They are quick to answer and fix issues and questions we have. One particular guy's name ""Cody"" who's always the best at helping me resolve my issues and getting me taken care of.  Hey BOLD, give this dude a raise!"	706
71	5	2018-08-12T00:00:00Z	"Not being very tech I had to concentrate on setting it all up BUT the customer support is amazing. When I got stuck they logged in to finish my set up and when I couldn't work out the variants for a subscription box the replies were always fast and helpful. 

Already have members joining and a solid back end to now focus on after the first sale from paid ads. I'm confident this will grow into 1000's of paying members over the next 12-18 months. Love the platform and it works perfectly. More importantly my customers love it because they can now buy something they have been asking for. 
By all means check it out

Also, a 90 day FREE TRIAL and you get all this amazing support!? What's not to love. They know that with results you will stay with them and what better way than to assume the risk and set up help that clearly costs them in the beginning. 

An awesome app, great support, brilliant free trial and a fantastic membership platform that works! 

I Can't recommend enough. A genuine 5*'s 

Jay Roberts"	707
71	5	2018-08-08T00:00:00Z	Amazing Support From GURI, he took the time to understand my problem and help me all the way to a perfect solution, really useful app so far...	708
71	5	2018-08-06T00:00:00Z	We use a few different Bold apps and they all work great.  Their customer support is fast to respond and they have helped to troubleshoot issues that even involve other apps when they spot the problem.	709
71	5	2018-08-04T00:00:00Z	We were using ReCharge and recently switched over to Bold. The team made the migration extremely easy. They were able to transfer over all our subscribers with no issues. The app runs much smoother, is more intuitive and has better aesthetics than ReCharge. Highly recommend, great app/team.	710
72	5	2018-08-03T00:00:00Z	"I think Bold Apps trully rock. The level of coding and development is plain impressive and the support is just something else... just outstanding!
I use 4 Bold apps and will stick with them each time i find a Bold app when searching to solve or add anything to my store.
They have gone out of their way to customize the apps just as i need them... Everybody there just rocks... specialy Julian Vansteenbergen. Congratulations to all!"	711
72	1	2018-08-03T00:00:00Z	Destroyed my store. Broke multiple buttons, asked bold to uninstall it from my code but they refused and instead RE-INSTALLED it. Bulky store-interrupting code is not removed when you delete their app. Had to give them staff access (for the code uninstall they did not do) and they did not fix my buttons their code broke and they uninstalled another unrelated app that I had running abusing their admin powers.	712
72	5	2018-08-02T00:00:00Z	Bold's support team has been awesome! KYLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping us get our setup right and being there every step of the way until things were exactly right.	713
72	5	2018-08-02T00:00:00Z	Excellent app and great customer service. Thanks to Pratibha for the fast turnaround and support.	714
72	5	2018-08-01T00:00:00Z	"The Store Support is Incredible!!

Exceptional Support from Scott, supporting a number of issues and changes we were looking to make. 

He was patience (with myself - a non code expert) and more importantly responsive and efficient!

I cannot thank or rate the Bold customer service support team enough!!"	715
72	5	2018-07-25T00:00:00Z	This app has been great, and the support has been top notch. Pratibha was incredibly helpful in solving an issue I was having. Highly recommend!	716
72	5	2018-07-23T00:00:00Z	"Fantastic app, with a great team that helped us with the migration! They helped us after the migration too on all sorts of little issues as we negotiated all the quirks of the new system.

Special shout out to Guri for saving the day when I accidentally deleted a subscription, and showing me how to get it back.

Great app, top notch support! Would definitely recommend."	717
72	5	2018-07-21T00:00:00Z	They helped me very well, great support! I was a bit lost in using and installing the app initially, but Parminder walked me through it and helped me out quickly and efficiently. There haven't been any orders via Bold yet, but I can definitely recommend them based on their support :)	718
72	5	2018-12-11T00:00:00Z	"We have updated this review after the Bold team reached out to us and quickly solved what we believe were a few bugs specific to our site. 

We are hoping the custom box will be as important to our business model as we believe, and this is certainly the feature that sets the Bold subscription app apart.

UPDATE: They've also improved the Subscription Manager on the User-end. It's way more user-friendly! Rony from support team provided outstanding support for some questions and custom requirements we had."	719
72	5	2018-07-18T00:00:00Z	"Amazing app. Anytime I can manage customers depending on their requests.
Support guys are always kind, really helpful."	720
73	5	2018-07-16T00:00:00Z	This app is the backbone of my store. Most of my sales are now subscription, and it makes it so easy for me! I retain customers and don't have to worry about billing. A favorite feature is the customization with subscription intervals, my customers can get orders every week or every other week, or however often they want. Bold then automatically sends me their orders based on their preferences, and I don't have to try and keep track of it all in a 3rd system. It's so lovely. Subscriptions are also easy to pause, discount, refund, or cancel. I'm really pleased. I waited my full free 3 month trial before writing this review to make sure it was a good fit. It is! highly recommend.	721
73	5	2018-07-12T00:00:00Z	I haven't actually sold any recurring orders through the app/interface on my website yet, but I'm impressed at just how much this thing will do. The learning curve can be steep and a lot of the options aren't exactly self explanatory, but with some patience and playing around, I'm super happy with how everything is layed out and how much you can do with it. Looking forward to seeing it in action when the first AutoShip customers come through my door! I've also used the support chat twice, and got quick and helpful solutions to the issues I was having. A big shout out to Parminder for the excellent customer service today!	722
73	5	2018-07-11T00:00:00Z	This app is great but the customer service is better! Big thanks to Joao and the rest of the team!! I assume th erest of the tema is good because i never had to go past Joao to get everything fixed !	723
73	5	2018-07-11T00:00:00Z	Great app and even greater help desk. Shout out to ARVINDER - very patient and helpful and also pointed out the real issue I have and it's not even from the BOLD APPS. :D	724
73	5	2018-07-11T00:00:00Z	Their apps have been great for our website/business and the customer service is phenomenal as well!	725
73	5	2018-07-11T00:00:00Z	Great support, Great app just switched from Woocommerce / WooSubscriptions and LOVING this App and the working with the Bold team as our new business partners!  highly recommend this app to anybody running a subscriptions business.  1 Suggestion, would be awesome if both recurring orders and once of only orders ran through the Bold Cashier app:)	726
73	5	2018-07-10T00:00:00Z	Customer service online (chat) was really helpful. Guri was able to guide me to apply discount to specific recurring customers.	727
73	5	2018-07-10T00:00:00Z	"Shipping highly perishable baked goods, our shop has needs that are quite different from many others. As usual, the Bold support team goes above and beyond to make this App work for us. 

This is functionality that would've cost in the mid six-figure range to build out just a few years back - unbelievable! Highly recommended."	728
73	5	2018-06-29T00:00:00Z	Recurring Orders by Bold is a professional and flexible application that I was able to style to match my theme. Installation was involved, which is to be expected, and the team was on hand to help as soon as I needed anything. Even a couple months in, when I email support, they're quick to determine the root of the problem and even faster to solve it. Great work, guys! Keep it up!	729
73	5	2018-06-28T00:00:00Z	Parminder Grewal was exceptional in helping resolve my Bold App issues. He took extra care to make sure I understood the steps required clear up our difficulty. He patiently walked me through those steps.  I would recommend this app and their customer care for anyone needing this type of service. This was a very helpful experience.	730
74	5	2018-06-26T00:00:00Z	"Great experience with bold!

There have now been 2 or 3 times where I was looking for something very specific on my product page and not only did they have great customer service, but they also addressed the issues in a timely manner.

My most recent experience was with Parminder who was able to quickly help me out! I'm a big fan of bold!"	731
74	4	2018-06-26T00:00:00Z	"I can't believe that I am going through this!!! ok Jay Myers you emailed me to give your app a review so here it is it took me 10 months of dealing with hundreds of people over seas as well as in the states, but for some reason now that I have launched our project your bold app was the only one that was able to bring me to tears.
 I must have 5 open tickets at this point and every single one comes back with a nice message saying we got you a ticket number and we are here to help, contact us with details so that we can further assist you, however I  have yet to find a return email to continue the conversation. I keep getting errors to every email address to every person that says they are willing to help. Mel said she had some answers  for my glitch and apparently send that message to a wrong email and when I reply to her it came back as an error same thing with Mitchelle who was so concerned with resolving my issues yet again no where to be found when I needed the help. Seems to me that this app should be called sign up and may God help you because your going to need it. Basically you guys are so darn busy with updating your auto reply emails and auto responses to all of life's questions, but for a NEW client who could potentially give you thousands of dollars in business you just  ignore. So disappointing and FYI this is my only review I have ever left for an app I don't have time to sit here and write this shit, but you left me no choice enough is enough. Now if you can Have a  actual human call me that would be much appreciated. 
* UPDATE got a call from Paul from management a few min after this review and he scheduled Brett who helped with our Tech issues and went through each issue one by one with my programmer. I was going to delete this review, but I decided to update it and say that they actually did help the Client and followed up Now I can't say that about the original people who were trying to pass the buck along, except they cant possible image the stress you are under that moment when you are about to lose thousands of dollars but most of all lose your reputation as a company and to me its never about the money, more about the customer. Thank you Brett for the Help."	732
74	5	2018-06-22T00:00:00Z	Very great experience! This is perfect. The popup work better than even their large competitor Cross Sell (which is way more glitchy). Super happy I tried this app out. Going to be a must-have app going forward for sure for my other stores!	733
74	5	2018-06-19T00:00:00Z	The BOLD team has gone above and beyond to help my business launch successfully. They have been attentive to my customers needs and done well to respond to our inquiries quickly.	734
74	5	2018-06-18T00:00:00Z	I don't have this live yet, but the app was super easy to install, and configure. The BOLD team are quick to respond to questions and concerns as well, and even sent a checkup email about a month after I installed to make sure I liked it. Great customer service.	735
74	5	2018-06-18T00:00:00Z	We have utilized Bold apps in a couple of our Shopify stores and so far have had great success with their functionality (Shopify's native checkout is the only issue with any app Bold or not). Bold's support team is awesome and always has great responsiveness to help fix any issue that may arise. We highly recommend installing one of their apps for your store. You won't be disappointed!	736
74	5	2018-06-18T00:00:00Z	If I could give BOLD 10 Stars I would! Firstly, the Customer Service is the BOMB! I know I’ve been such a pain in the butt because I am picky and trying to create a customized website with recurring features is tough and BOLD made it happen! I am so in love with my website and the features that BOLD has to offer for my Subscription Box. Michelle and Jordan have been so patient in working with me and creating features I never thought I could! I had a vision, and honestly didn’t think it would work. Michelle in Customer Support kept me up-to-date multiple times a day while working along side Jordan in Development to make sure all the bugs were worked out somwhen a customer purchases a Subscription Box which is part of their reoccurring app, they can chose to end their subscription after 4 gift boxes. Is BOLD technical? Yes! Not going to lie to you however, you get what you pay for and BOLD isn’t going to stop at what they’ll be able to offer in the future. I can already tell they’re yearning to create a user friendly experience by not only supporting their customers, but by asking questions on what it is we are looking for and need our website to do. Bold is based out of Canada and they work well when you email their support team and create a ticket.  I simply just keep responding to that ticket and they always get back to me within 24-48 hours. In the beginning, I didn’t know how to use the app, but if you take the time to train on it and figure it out, it’s actually not that bad and makes a lot of sense to me. Don’t look anywhere else if you’re a Subscription Box Company and need recurring orders processed. If you can get passed the technical frustrations (remember we are not developers) and learn some of the tech jargon, then you can explain to them what it is you need done. They are great listeners and genuinely want to help and see your business grow. To me, that is priceless!	737
74	5	2018-06-19T00:00:00Z	The subscription app is good. Customer service was not responding to 2 of my voice messages at first, but apparently they had a technical issue. After I complained they called me and got everything fixed and were very helpful. Hopefully they won't have any technical issues receiving messages from customers anymore.	738
74	2	2018-06-14T00:00:00Z	"Customer service is good (I suggest emailing over the live chat). 
However, the app bugged on us on our first day of launching and while bold fixed the issue after 1 full day, they were completely unhelpful in helping us save the customers we lost due to the fault in the app."	739
74	5	2018-06-14T00:00:00Z	"Great app, we longer have to manually track customers orders that want automatic re-order each week. It's really easy to use and navigate, so far no issues.
Service is also quick and seamless, Pratibha, in particular, helped me solve a few queries via the live chat really quickly. Great service!"	740
75	5	2018-06-14T00:00:00Z	I don't know why I waited so long to install this app. Our customers love it and it more than paid for itself on the first day we launched the app... for the entire year! This will only improve over time. Always happy with the BOLD Apps and their customer service in case something breaks. Check out their apps in action at www.miabella.co	741
75	5	2018-06-11T00:00:00Z	If I could give Bold 10 stars, I would.  Having initially tested Bold's competitor--ReCharge--I can say unequivocally Bold is the winner in terms of both customer service and product.  From start to finish, Brett, Victoria and the team at Bold made the integration seamless for our team and recurring subscriptions have been working great.  Their interface in Shopify is intuitive and they make it super-easy to manage subscriptions.  While I can quibble about small things in the app, Bold's onboarding process, UX and functionality blows away ReCharge's experience--seriously, it's not even close.  But hands down, the best part about Bold for us was working with the customer experience master Brett.  He was extremely patient with our barrage of questions and answered thoughtfully with step-by-step screenshots.  In 2018, Bold sets the gold standard for customer service.	742
75	5	2018-06-06T00:00:00Z	This is probably the most convenient recurring app out there. I was originally on recharge which had zero build a box features. so changing to bold was an easy decision.  My biggest complaint with most of these companies has been the lack of instant help, however team member Guri was available on chat and omg he was extremely helpful.  Live chat is key!!  Thanks Bold for keeping it innovative! We've made a ton of money on this app!	743
75	5	2018-06-04T00:00:00Z	"The customer service is awesome, and the app works exactly as intended. Clean UI and even better instructions. Did i mention that the customer service is awesome already? cause it definitely is. Resolved my issue within 5 mins compared to Recharge subscriptions which took 3 days to figure out what I wanted to fix in the first place. 

Highly recommend the Bold ecosystem of apps."	744
75	5	2018-05-28T00:00:00Z	I have to start by saying that the customer service provided by Bold is hands down worth every single penny the app costs! I've used other upsell apps before, but never received such timely and personalized customer service. I worked specifically with Tim and Julian, and both were super responsive, helpful, and polite. Plus, the app is really user friendly and simple to understand!	745
75	4	2018-05-28T00:00:00Z	We are a startup company and really appreciate what Bold adds to our store. The customer service has been quick and very helpful! Thank you Bold! Keep growing!	746
75	4	2018-07-26T00:00:00Z	No doubt that this is a pretty decent app with many capabilities. We had some real issues to begin with, as the weaknesses of individual modes weren't made clear (the marketing is pretty good but it hides a few shortfalls). The first line service wasn't great and it didn't seem like we'd get anywhere. However, once we got through to the right people the service was excellent and the advice much better. In fact they went out of their way to help resolve our issues. Julian, Brett and James all brilliant in the end hence why I'll upgrade to 4 stars barring any further issues. Difficult to choose a rating here, as it has gone from 1 star to really excellent service, but James, Brett and Julian have been excellent recently...	747
75	5	2018-05-25T00:00:00Z	Great service, super helpful customer support!	748
75	5	2018-05-23T00:00:00Z	Absolutely awesome, easy to manage, we currently grow about 100 subscriptions each month and the bold apps make day to day management really easy...	749
75	5	2018-05-23T00:00:00Z	solid! Although i had a little bit of difficulty with the inital set up (due to my own rushing), David and Guri from BOLD got be straight in no time! Very professional and quick responses, what more can you ask for.	750
76	5	2018-05-22T00:00:00Z	We have build our entire subscription business using this app and are incredibly satisfied with the features, ease of use, ease of implementation and absolutely love the customer service offered. We need to give a special shout out to Jevon, Kyle and Tim who have helped us in crucial situations and even on the weekends. We really appreciate it guys and thanks for creating something so effective and easy to use and implement.	751
76	5	2018-05-19T00:00:00Z	Great support - and even over the weekend. Thanks everyone!	752
76	5	2018-05-19T00:00:00Z	Great Support. Thanks to Guri for all the help. He saved me heaps of time and took care of the issue in no time. I don't think they pay him enough at BOLD and he needs to be put forward for promotion. Take the rest of the day off mate.	753
76	5	2018-05-13T00:00:00Z	Leanne has been excellent the entire process of migrating over from Recharge by answering questions in a timely manner and ensuring we accomplished our transfer before our 3PL transition occurred. There were a lot of moving pieces and Leanne helped clarify our decisions. Thank you so much! Glad to be on this awesome platform with great support!	754
76	5	2018-05-10T00:00:00Z	Leanne Lucas has been absolutely amazing. I’m not a very tech savvy person so learning to use a new app made me apprehensive. Leanne was quick to respond and answered all of our questions giving us clarity and the confidence we needed moving into our new business. Thank you Leanne and the people from BOLD :)	755
76	5	2018-05-05T00:00:00Z	We were able to get this app up and running extremely fast. We had the company install it and they did it in less than 2 days. It is simple to use and understand. We are a very small shop with no tech support in-house so ease of use is critical for us.	756
76	4	2018-05-03T00:00:00Z	"Very happy with the recurring orders & subscription app by Bold… it allows us to achieve a simple and easy-to-use option for our customers, and any small issues we've experienced have been dealt with swiftly and smoothly by the support team.

Our only gripe is that, visually, it doesn't look as slick as we might hope. But as a starting point for offering subscriptions it does what it needs to do… pimping is the next stage!"	757
76	5	2018-04-30T00:00:00Z	Amazing support. Always answers promptly and tremendous when solving problems. Julian is a big help too!	758
76	5	2018-04-28T00:00:00Z	Quick and easy setup & great customer service!	759
76	5	2018-04-27T00:00:00Z	GENIUS! Great customer service and easy to use	760
77	5	2018-04-22T00:00:00Z	So far - really great support and easy to use. We only went live with out recurring orders today, but so far it seems customers are able to use it easily. Fingers crossed!	761
77	5	2018-04-11T00:00:00Z	We just started using this app. Results are excellent so far. It is easy to set up and does everything we expected.	762
77	5	2018-03-26T00:00:00Z	"This is a great app but really wish it included a capability to manually create a re-occurring order.  We have many elderly customers who don't like to use any type of technology and call in for orders.

Other than that, its simple and easy to use."	763
77	4	2018-03-23T00:00:00Z	I am fairly new to this app and so far I am pretty satisfied with the ease of creating subscription options for my customers. I really like to the diversity in frequency of shipping with their option. I do have a bit of an issue with the coupon codes not seemig to sync between the app and the Shopify store, as we do offer % discounts as well as free shipping discount codes to certain customers. Overall, so far I am pleased with using the App for my company.	764
77	5	2018-03-22T00:00:00Z	"So far, I'm totally impressed by the amazing service by the support team!  Leanne has patiently helped us work through What seems like a million questions.  She has provided detailed answers and instructions in a timely manner, allowing us to move forward with the setup. Whenever she didn't have an answer to a particular question, she followed through and got back to us within a short time with the answer (she was able to answer most questions right away!).  It was nice to see how closely she worked with Brad on the Tier 2 team, for design changes which have allowed us to create a seamless checkout experience for our customers. Leanne always communicated our requests clearly and Brad would complete the edits within the 1-2 business day turnaround time. We appreciate Brad working with us on the perfect design details. We have been blown away by the attention the team at Bold has shown us and look forward to launching our new subscription program very soon.  

Many thanks to your team for the excellent service!

77	5	2018-03-22T00:00:00Z	There are some hiccups, but nothing that can never be fixed, taught (with patience I might add) or assisted with in an expedited manner by Bold's service team. We have had nothing but stellar customer service with Bold, and are very happy! Shout out to Javon, Arcee, Genevieve, Cam, and whomever else always helps us out. Thank you!	766
77	4	2018-12-05T00:00:00Z	"**Update: I have reduced my star rating from 5 to 4 based on: (1) customers not being able to pause subscriptions (just push the date out) and (2) not being able to see or follow up abandoned carts (I think this is possible with Cashier but not with just this App) and (3) there was at least a day when the cart simply wasn't working at all due to an unexpected Shopify update on the backend. Guidance for customers on how to log in and adjust subscriptions doesn't exist which is also a significant weakness - I see on Hotjar a lot of people struggling with this. The support staff are still exceptional and the App has allowed me to build a subscription business and so despite these weaknesses it still deserves 4 stars. **

Bold have repeatedly asked me to review the app, as do most developers, but I wanted to wait until I had a decent amount of experience with it, which I now do.

The app has great functionality and the team is fast to help. It's remarkable what you get for only $20 a month. I won't go into all the features - I think Bold's sales pitch does that pretty thoroughly!

The best thing you can get from reviews is knowing where the skeletons are. So that's what I'm going to do, but keep in mind this app is categorically a 5 star offering.

In the back end it feels like you have two stores, with parts of it syncing really well, and other parts being manual and sometimes clunky.

For example, I have found the process for deleting items from your store and then from the Bold's app difficult. There is a clear guide from Bold on how to do this, and it should be simple, but clicking the links in the app to fix issues with having deleted items on subscriptions often just ends up with the fix 'hanging' - much the same as the cursor on your Mac turns into a spinning colourful ball. I have found that if you leave it for hours it eventually works. I've brought this up with the team but haven't had success in getting them to understand the problem (they think that I'm not able to follow the steps, but I can, it's an issue of speed.)

Coupon codes don't sync between the app and the Shopify store. This isn't a huge deal for me as I'm not using hundreds of them. It's something to consider though if you are using a lot of coupon codes as depending on your business you may often be entering them all twice. 

You also can't give a 0% or $0 discount with a coupon code like you can in Shopify. This may seem weird but there is a use case for it - you can sync Bold with Refersion (which is great), but if you want a referral code to only reward the referrer but not the buyer then you want the buyer to enter the code, have it trigger in Refersion but not discount the purchase price. The use case here is that if the Referral partner is a charity and the buyers are motivated to enter the code to help the charity and not to get a discount. This is a rare example, but still getting out in the open.

But again, this is a $20 app, and see all the cool stuff it does in Bold's description. It still easily gets 5 stars - the value for money is remarkable. I just want to add value in this review by telling you what they obviously won't. 

I can't fault the functionality and flexibility in what you can do with subscriptions, in terms of having one off orders and subscriptions, having a mix etc etc, clearly described in Bold's sales pitch. It's all true and amazing. 

The portal for the customer is functional, but without spending money on development (which at this point I can't afford) it does not bring any 'delight' to the customer. It does what it needs to do, but the user experience could do with some improvements. The first thing I would do is create a video that appears when the customer logs in for the first time which would show them what all the buttons do and how to use them. For example, of course the store owner knows that the customer can reduce the next order without reducing the following orders, but the customer doesn't know this. A tech savy person may work it out, others may just delete their subscription. So communicating the amazing flexibility of the software with the end user is a huge potential area of improvement. Polishing that portal up for out of the box users would also be great. It lacks beauty. Again, it's $20 a month. Perhaps they could have a second tier that costs more but has these additional features.

Be aware that there are loads of potential emails that can go to customers when different actions are triggered (such as a change in delivery date, qty, price, etc etc) and at some point early on you are going to want to invest a significant amount of time in customising those emails. The ability to customise them is a feature, but factor it into your planning.

The single biggest warning I will give to people considering this app is this: be clear about what you want to offer customers before you install it. Don't make my mistake. The app offers so much flexibility and functionality that it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking ""whoa, I didn't even think about the ability to do that!"". Before you know it you may start thinking about changing your business model because of what you can do with the app. This is dangerous territory - and a trap I've well and truly fallen into. A monthly subscription box is nice and simple. You can do WAY more than this with Bold's app. The question I have to keep asking myself is should I? Or am I falling in love with the technology and not the customers?"	767
77	5	2019-07-05T00:00:00Z	So far things have been great. I'm using Recurring Orders and Customer Pricing app together. Having both functions coming from the same parent company has been awesome to have them work and integrate together. It took a bit to transfer all my information over from my previous app, but the support team was really helpful throughout the entire process. Cody, Harpreet, and Brenda have been great. Now that it's up and running, provides huge value to my company. Highly recommended!	768
77	5	2018-03-17T00:00:00Z	"As soon as we implemented your app in favour of the one we had originally, we got our 1st subscriber and then within the day, we got the2nd. It's easy, flexible and cost effective - just what we need as a start up store

Your team are seamlessly active like your part of my team

77	5	2018-03-16T00:00:00Z	I love this APP so far.  The Bold team help setup my recurring subscription on to my theme with no extra cost.  I couldn't be happier with the support that I have received so far from Bold Apps.  Thanks again!!!	770
78	5	2018-03-15T00:00:00Z	Customer service from Bold is excellent. Highly recommended.	771
78	5	2018-03-14T00:00:00Z	Great app integrates seamlessly! I would recommend this over all the others!	772
78	5	2018-03-13T00:00:00Z	Installing this App is the best thing I ever did to grow my Shopify store. Recurring orders makes it easier for us to plan ahead. My customers love the convenience. I love knowing there's money coming in with Bold's super intelligent dash board. If you're worried about tech issues, don't. Bold's people are awesome, responsive and problems solvers. They even work late nights and on the weekends and honor special requests. Special thumbs up to Leanne at Bold for making my problem (caused by me, not Bold's issue) her emergency!! I couldn't function at this level without this App. This App pays for itself everyday! <3 you Bold Apps!	773
78	5	2018-03-10T00:00:00Z	This is a terrific app.  It takes a while to get it installed and configured, but I really like its functionality.  I needed some specific, customized design changes and the support team went in and made them for me on the code for my site, which is super helpful since I don't know how to code myself.  I do wish this app had more functionality built in for customizing the checkout page and the manage your subscriptions page.  Hopefully in a future edition.  But, the support team went in and made some of those adjustments for me, which was super helpful.	774
78	5	2018-03-07T00:00:00Z	The BOLD team are awesome! They were able to implement a new feature within the Recurring Orders app that I requested. I have still yet to launch my site but just based on the interactions I've had with their team so far I am impressed.	775
78	5	2019-01-24T00:00:00Z	This app is great for our recurring floral subscriptions. We have weekly, monthly and occasion subscriptions. The BOLD developers are quick to respond and have helped me tremendously. I'm not a developer and they're patient and great communicators. I worked with Cody, and he helped me resolve issues quickly.	776
78	1	2018-03-04T00:00:00Z	I think its inhumane to not give all of your customers the live chat option within their account. Just the fact that these customers are relying on customer support and we are making customers suffer because your company doesn't want to offer live chat to help figure things out unless you are paying a large amount.	777
78	5	2018-03-02T00:00:00Z	I use this app not for shipping physical products but for recurring memberships that work with other auto-tagging apps and discount codes. It works great so far — there are a couple features I wish it had, but don't expect it to since we don't really use it exactly the way it was intended to be used. The support team is AMAZING! They will customize anything on the front end for you at your request. I highly recommend using this app and the team behind it.	778
78	5	2018-03-02T00:00:00Z	Bold customer service is on POINT! best of the best!	779
78	5	2018-03-01T00:00:00Z	"I have been using BOLD for almost a year now, and I have really been satisfied. The app is just working great, is flexible and the customer support are always ready to assist if any unexpected problem is coming up! 

Thumbs up to Morgan and Victoria for great great service!"	780
79	5	2018-02-26T00:00:00Z	This is a very good app that works flawlessly and provides all the functionality you need to manage recurring orders. Their support team go above and beyond and are exceptionally helpful.	781
79	5	2018-02-16T00:00:00Z	"After a long and hard decision I decided to sign up with Bold but after waiting for two business days for the liquid installation I got impatient and decided to go with another Recurring Orders app service. I was however, blown away by the professional response that I received from the Bold team expressing their sincere ""Sorry to see you leave"". I was aware that a number of the Apps services send out automated responses, but it was the next message ""Hello Ruth, I see that Recurring Orders was just uninstalled about 20 minutes earlier. Can we still be of assistance here? Ron from Bold"" that got me thinking. 

So after waiting for almost four business days with another Recurring Orders app service to set up for me, I had a change of heart and decided to go back to Bold. I humbly said I wanted to give them another go and within two days I was set up and was up and running. I must say the service and prompt responses from the Bold is really exceptional. I am loving the quick and easy set up for my store and the flexible editing tools. This is really the perfect Recurring Orders app service for my store. I already have customers waiting to sign up. I am still getting support from the team and they are super quick to respond and it makes me feel like I'm their 'only customer'. Thanks and keep up the good work."	782
79	5	2018-02-15T00:00:00Z	I will never use another app for my subscription box business solely because their customer service is unmatched. Especially my boy Morgains. its like he's some sort of programming super hero. I vote we legit change his name to Dark Morgan or Shadow Morgan. Seriously though, give Morgan a raise and and a pat on his super hero cape.	783
79	5	2018-02-15T00:00:00Z	"Their are two things I look for in a software company when searching for a solution. Quality support, and software that is easy to use.

Bold recurring fit my buisness perfectly and after getting it setup I can have products making profit in minutes.

Now to the most important Quality... Superior Support. The support is not only the best I have ever seen but it would be very hard for anyone to emulate. Raj who is absolutely the best tech person I have ever seen has set the bar for every technician in the world. His knowledge is far and above, his manor and approach to his customers is superior. And he is absolutely one of the nicest people I have worked with.

Thank you Raj, and the entire Bold Recuring team.

79	5	2018-02-13T00:00:00Z	This is my favourite app I have installed to date.  I have an online pet supplies store and I have already  several customers signed up for recurring orders for dog supplies. Support has also been excellent.	785
79	5	2018-02-12T00:00:00Z	Superb app and even greater support team. Thank you so much for your help!	786

79	5	2018-02-10T00:00:00Z	We've used other subscriptions apps before but the Bold Recurring Orders app is by far the best one out there.  They are constantly making improvements and trying to make the app better for the user, which we love!!  Bold Support is great too, they don't just let you install the app and then forget about you.  If you need help they are there for you.	788
79	5	2018-02-08T00:00:00Z	SO far it's been amazing! We just launched a subscription service on our site and needed some extra help to get it up and running. The app itself hits all the checkboxes but what really separated Bold from everyone else was their customer support. Leanne was awesome in helping us get set up helping with the custom changes and making sure we had a great understanding of everything before launch!	789
79	4	2018-02-08T00:00:00Z	"The recurring orders app is very good not perfect but I love it.
There’s some bugs with the language settings sometimes (French to English) but the support team is there to walk you through all the steps to resolve the issues! I would go further and tell you that the support team itself worth the price!"	790
80	5	2018-12-05T00:00:00Z	"This app works very well.

I am able to accept recurring orders which has the potential to provide a significant business benefit over time - both in revenue and profits.

I had the Bold developers made a custom modification to make a fixed time and # units for the Subscribe and Save offer and this is working well.

This app has worked well with my FBA Shipping app, i.e. the recurring orders are created, then sent to Amazon for shipping, and the shipping information comes back to Shopify.

All customer email notifications are working well.

The only issue is that the change of domains in the checkout broke reporting by Google Analytics.  This is still an open ticket with support.

Overall, I am very happy with this app and would certainly recommend it to other Shopify sites looking for a Subscription app."	791
80	5	2018-01-31T00:00:00Z	"Best Customer Service EVER!!! Leanne is amazing, she fixed the issues I was having before I even knew there was an issue. 
Because of her amazing service, I will definitely be a long term customer.
I wish all App teams were as helpful :)"	792

80	5	2018-01-27T00:00:00Z	The team is very supportive. Howerver the app has so many features and still hard to navigate and understanding. Overall, good experience	794
80	5	2018-01-24T00:00:00Z	A++++ Support!  Raj was very quick to respond and knowledgeable!   He helped us get up and running quickly!	795
80	5	2018-01-23T00:00:00Z	Does exactly what it is supposed to, rather beating around the bush like others.	796
80	5	2018-01-19T00:00:00Z	Easy to set up and makes it easy for people to subscribe to your subscription service. Recommended!	797
80	5	2018-01-22T00:00:00Z	We were using ReCharge for over a year but as we grew, the app couldn't grow with us and felt like there was a lack of support and features. So decided to give Bold a try and I have been blown away by the features, and more importantly the prompt support!! Leanne has been extremely wonderful in helping with the migration and all other question's i've thrown her way! There's definitely some learning curve but it'll be worth it!	798
80	5	2018-01-19T00:00:00Z	So far so good, a few issues, but with the support of Jevon and his team all problems were fixed, very quickly. Nice to install an app and actually be provided with quick and knowledgeable support. Thanks Bold	799
80	5	2018-01-19T00:00:00Z	So far this app has been a great solution for us as we wanted to include the option to subscribe to our product families. Customer care has been great as well, they respond to inquiries quickly and with great detail. The bold customer care team has been great to us which helps us ensure we are providing the best customer care to our consumers!	800
81	5	2018-01-16T00:00:00Z	We needed to update our recurring subscriptions.  It was WAY more work than we anticipated.  Leanne held our hands the whole time until it was all handled, even over the Christmas holiday.  Other customer support staff, like Paul, are very knowledgeable, helpful and patient when other issues arise.  Definitely recommend to others...	801
81	5	2018-01-16T00:00:00Z	Paul is great! Helped me with everything I needed. I've been using this app now for a while and it has been great :)	802
81	5	2018-01-15T00:00:00Z	"I know very little about coding, but you don't need to be a coding genius to use this app - Bold is very easy to install and if you run into ANY issues, their customer service team will fix it in record speed. 

You should know:
1. If you email them, you'll hear from them almost immediately.  I know that if I email them with a question at 10am, I'll have an answer to that question by 2 or 3pm. This isn't normal, but it's absolutely incredible. 

2. You do not need to be a genius to set this up.

3. This app has tons of features and will fit any kind of subscription you want to offer. I couldn't recommend this enough.

4. The membership portal for your customers is very nice and easy to use. Your customers will thank you.

5. They have several different payment gateways to use (stripe, braintree) which is great!  I was told that paypal checkout would be supported (through braintree) within the next 1-2 months. 

6. I am thrilled with the decision to buy this app and I'm certain you will, too. It's cliché, but this app is actually worth every penny.

If you get this app, you'll probably get to work with some of Bold's finest support staff - like Leanne. She is incredible. I asked Leanne a billion and one questions  to the point where I'm sure I was just being super stupid half the time and she always responded within a couple hours to help me figure this or that out.

Brad, Brenden, Victoria, and James - each one of you took the time to respond to me in such a kind way - thanks!!"	803
81	5	2018-01-14T00:00:00Z	"We use over half of all BOLD apps for our store and this app has been a huge benefit to our brick & mortar/online store. Our members LOVE the fact they can ""set it and forget it"" as well as the versatility it offers them. In the 6 months since we installed this app, we have so far secured over $16,000/yr just in recurring sales. It has created a whole new level of customer loyalty! The only wish I would have for improvement is if the app could automatically adjust recurring order pricing based on price adjustments made in our Shopify. It's been the only tedious and time-consuming part."	804
81	5	2018-01-11T00:00:00Z	"We use the Bold Reoccuring Orders App. We are a new online store (3months) and have already booked over $500 dollars a year in reoccurring orders. That $500 would not have happened if not for the Bold App. Each month we get more subscribers ! 
Additionally we ran into a glitch after Holiday Sales Peomotions wee over and Leanne with Bold  and Morhan from the Tier 2 Team - were right on it !
We are a small company NOW LOL but with Bold behind us we have a TEAM"	805
81	5	2018-01-09T00:00:00Z	"This App has worked very well for my store.  It is easy for me as a store owner as well as my customers to manage their subscriptions.  Customer service has also been very good.

Chad"	806
81	5	2018-01-09T00:00:00Z	Using this app combined with Bold's Product Options app has been perfect for our Wine Club subscription model. Bold's support team has been awesome and very helpful as well!	807
81	5	2018-10-02T00:00:00Z	"I absolutely love how the app simply takes care of it all! I am new to this business, but set up was easy, smooth sailing for my customers so far -- I'm grateful for an app that made my business idea become a reality -- a subscription based health resource!

They answered all my questions so patiently as I was choosing which app would work best for my business! Cody and Brenden were super helpful as I've had questions along the way."	808
81	5	2018-01-05T00:00:00Z	The customer service is one of the best I've ever seen. Members of the Bold team go above and beyond to help with any questions or challenges. I would definitely recommend this product.	809
81	5	2018-01-05T00:00:00Z	The recurring orders app has worked wonders for us in retaining our quarterly magazine subscribers, and the team at Bold has been extraordinarily helpful, especially Leanne, who's worked with us tirelessly to make the app's flexibility and multiple features work to our advantage. I can't recommend them -- and their excellent, effective, and patient customer service -- enough! Thank you Leanne and team for making our business so much better, and more profitable!	810
82	5	2018-01-05T00:00:00Z	Simple to use, great execution	811
82	5	2017-12-29T00:00:00Z	easy to setup and exactly what I was looking for!!	812
82	5	2017-12-29T00:00:00Z	"I have been using the app for over 4 months now and it works great. Easy to use for both the Customer and Admin. About 10% of our orders are now recurring. 

Support and integration services are also great with the team very responsive and eager to help.

Highly recommended."	813
82	5	2017-12-27T00:00:00Z	"I'm super impressed with the customer service and responsiveness of the team at BOLD.   I had initially planned on using one of the other recurring subscription apps that was also rated 5 stars, but within the first 48 hours of downloading and initiating no word from them........still no word, LOL.

The user interface has been great and I have been able to easily update things on both my laptop and my mobile device (challenges with other apps).  

End of the day I am glad that the other guy dropped the ball and that we went with Bold.  I'm excited to try other apps that they provide as well.  

Specifically I have interacted with Victoria, LeAnne, Brenden and Josh.  Great people to work with and thanks for the support!"	814
82	5	2017-12-16T00:00:00Z	I can’t recommend this app and Bold customer service enough. I know nothing about coding and I found the app to be pretty easy to use. When I needed help, Victoria was AWESOME. She listened, gave good recommendations and even set some aspects up for me. I felt like she and the other Bold professionals were in my corner and wanted me to succeed. My first online order was for a recurring subscription so I’m thrilled that I used this app.	815
82	5	2017-12-15T00:00:00Z	Jordan did a great job setting up our account after a site theme change...super thankful for the help and to have our site fulling back up and running :)	816
82	5	2017-12-14T00:00:00Z	Really enjoy so far and great customer service. Easy install and great support by Jevon!	817
82	5	2018-10-31T00:00:00Z	I have tried another app and Bold is really fantastic. The app itself works great and their customer service is amazing. With technical questions, you do not want to be left by yourself trying to figure them out and they answer your email in a very timely manner and can even call you. Nothing better! Signup with closed eyes. I am very demanding and I am happy.	818
82	5	2017-12-08T00:00:00Z	"Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea recently launched a new Coffee Subscription service with help from Bold and they have played an integral role in getting our service live. We had tons of questions related to specific functions we wanted, tech issues and the best way to get our service off the ground and they were a TREMENDOUS help! Everyone on their support team was readily available, knowledgeable and overall lifesavers. I cannot thank them enough for helping us with all the little questions and confirmations that go into launching a subscription service. 

James, Robb, Jevon, Logan Brenden, Josh and their Tier II support team have all been there for me since Day 1. These are people behind an application worth paying for. 10/10!"	819
82	5	2017-12-07T00:00:00Z	"Having the add to cart button for my subscription products has made marketing campaigns so much easier.  I was not able to have marketing landing pages before but now I can.  It has made a big difference

It sounds ridiculous... but just the fact that someone always gets back to you within 24 hours is awesome.  For so many apps (like the vast majority) it is a toss up on whether you will get help at all and for the rest of them, the support takes a crazy amount of time bc they are overseas.  They answer a question at like 2AM...I get the answer and respond back at like 8AM... and then have to wait until 2AM the next day...and it goes on and on.  

But not with these guys... get right back to you and then follow up with you to make sure they answered the question to your satisfaction."	820
83	5	2017-12-06T00:00:00Z	"Epic support from Leanne!

She went above and beyond what I would expect for support. She even brought in the Tier II guys to do a little customization for us. They also did a great job!

In short, she solved a big problem for us because I had not set up our subscription box account correctly.
If you guys have Super Hero awards, please give her one to show my appreciation.

83	2	2017-12-05T00:00:00Z	This app is mediocre at best. Unfortunately, if you're looking to run a recurring subscription service you really only have two options. The unintuitive user interface, obnoxious automated emails, and lack of flexibility clearly demonstrates that there is a massive opportunity for someone else to come into this space and do this 10x better (with minimal effort).	822
83	5	2017-12-04T00:00:00Z	"As a new e-commerce store owner, it can be a confusing and difficult process navigating the many twists and turns of apps, coding, and customer processing. But Bold has made it seamless with Recurring Orders.

I was previously using a different app for autoships and was very dissatisfied with their customer service and backend, and Bold blew them out of the water. 

You do not need to think twice about using this app. Their customer service is beyond incredible (I wish I could hire them for my own company - specifically Leanne is a gem of a woman and my personal fairy godmother in all things autoship haha), the consumer facing app aesthetically pleasing, and the backend system robust.

I would recommend them to anyone wanting autoship, already have, and will continue to sing their praise."	823
83	5	2017-12-01T00:00:00Z	AWESOME APP. Super support. I used POWr for Wix and it was almost impossible. Thank you for a great product!	824
83	5	2017-11-30T00:00:00Z	Fantastic app for subscriptions.	825
83	5	2017-11-30T00:00:00Z	"We recently switched from Recharge and we are so glad we did. Hands down such a better app and when you use all the other great Bold apps like Upsell, Brain and Product Discount your store is ready to rock and your worries disappear. 

Hands down the best and fastest support staff we have ever experienced. We are so happy! 

Thank you BOLD!"	826
83	5	2019-08-20T00:00:00Z	"Update 2019 - still love this fabulous app with super service and great features improving all the time!

I so love this app and the wonderful service provided by the Bold team. I'd read other reviews that questioned this app's functionality - and I have a tricky subscription set up - but it has continued to deliver and already received more functionality as they regularly update it.  Well worth it.  Thanks Bold!"	827
83	5	2017-11-27T00:00:00Z	Love this app so much as it has made a very tedious job as easy as pie! Great customization options and even better support! Consistently come out with even better features as well! Good on ya Bold!	828
83	5	2017-11-25T00:00:00Z	Some of the most helpful support staff that I have encountered. Always informative and curious. Can't thank the staff at Bold, especially on the Recurring Orders App team, enough.	829
83	5	2017-11-24T00:00:00Z	"install steps are really well documented
support is AMAZING, if needed
open minded and solution oriented : they made me feel anything was possible
response time like I've never seen
totally recommend it"	830
84	5	2017-11-23T00:00:00Z	Great app and very helpful support - Brenden was very helpful!	831
84	5	2017-11-22T00:00:00Z	The support staff is SO helpful!	832
84	5	2017-11-21T00:00:00Z	Hands down the best subscription app on Shopify! Easy to use, very flexible and nimble to adjust to whatever your store needs are. Their support and developer team is incredible too, they pulled through last minute to complete an integration that I know a lot of their valued users appreciate. Permanent loyal fan of this app and the rest of the Bold suite of apps. Rockstar app, and rockstar team, keep up the great work!	833
84	5	2017-11-21T00:00:00Z	I don't usually write reviews, but this company warrants one. The feature set and functionality this app provides is as good as any other out there if not better (and we have tried a few). But what sets them apart is their service and professionalism. You are buying into a first class, full service organization by using this app and as any store owner knows, service is the most important thing we sell!	834
84	5	2020-04-13T00:00:00Z	"* Update April 13 2020 - As always, the Bold team has gone above and beyond for us many times. Carter helped us out today and fixed a problem I didn't think could be fixed. Carter made it easy. Very pleased. 

Previous review: Excellent, unprecedented customer support. I've had issues because of the complexity of what I was trying to do, (not because of the app... which actually makes things simpler...) and even when I thought I was being annoying, the Bold team members have been fast, helpful, and super friendly. Pretty amazing actually."	835
84	5	2017-11-16T00:00:00Z	"We've been working with Reoccurring Orders since July. The BOLD team is super responsive and helpful when we have questions regarding billing, processing, and even small items such as ""does your app have 'x' capability"" Robb specifically worked with us when our customers were not charged due to an error on our end of things, and helped get them recharged so we could continue with shipping our subscriptions as planned! Would recommend the app to all stores looking for an easy way to track subscriptions and view how well it is preforming!"	836
84	5	2017-11-16T00:00:00Z	"Our orders have become more consistent and predictable since we installed the Recurring Orders App.  The option to offer discounts for subscriptions seems to be appealing to our customers, and there are built in features to help ensure that people don't 'game the system' by ordering once at a lower rate, then cancelling the subscription.  Well done.

The customer service is also outstanding.  We had a conflict with another Shopify app, and Bold responded to us with a fix within ten to twenty minutes."	837
84	3	2017-11-15T00:00:00Z	Yes i like the app.  There seems to be a couple glitches using my Responsive theme.   On the subscribe drop downs the number and week or month over lap each other.  Also when starting a new subscription item or category it’s a little confusing when trying to use max number of recurring orders.  It makes me choose that in order to do a gift option. otherwise s good feature.	838
84	5	2017-11-03T00:00:00Z	Easy to set up subscriptions - great way to get rebuys.	839
84	5	2017-11-02T00:00:00Z	"This service is allowing me to offer my Monthly Pen Subscription Service with ease and little to no effort when it comes to maintaining the backend. Great customer service and technical service.

85	5	2018-06-08T00:00:00Z	"Hands down, we have never received better, more responsive customer service help than from the team at Bold Recurring Orders. We're using the Bold Recurring Orders app in a unique way, and the team has been at the ready to make customizations, help edit our subscription groups, tweak this that and the other thing, and in general guide us as we're continually building our website. Big shout out to Leanne, who has held my hand from the beginning, and Victoria, Brendan, and Robb too for their never-ending 'get-it-solved' magic! This app is more robust than any other on the market, and the Bold team will do whatever they can to help! 

Review 2.0 - Thanks to Michelle & the Bold developers for immediately investigating a shipping issue and finding a resolution. Bold is always ready to help!"	841
85	5	2017-10-30T00:00:00Z	I've been nothing but impressed since switching over. Everything runs without a hitch and is easily understood, but still has all the features you could want. The support team has been nothing short of legendary. I've asked Robb question after question and I'm always met with patience, eagerness to help, and solutions. Bold is awesome and I commend it to everyone.	842
85	5	2017-10-30T00:00:00Z	Brendan and his people were so fast (and accurate) with their responses that I was quite shocked. Amazing service!	843
85	5	2017-10-30T00:00:00Z	Amazing customer support from Raj dispite my barrage of questions. cant wait to use it officially once biz kicks off!	844
85	5	2017-10-26T00:00:00Z	"I must commend James Gudge, Tier 1 Client Success, Recurring Orders Team!

He fixed two items on my site that I noted and one I hadn't noticed. He was responsive, asked great questions to get to the root of my problem, and was a joy to work with. 

James, Thank You!"	845
85	1	2017-10-24T00:00:00Z	"Disappointed to find that this app doesn't follow the sales tax rules as defined within Shopify and can't be configured to correctly calculate taxes where more than one tax rate is required (which is common in the US).

Great looking app, very responsive technical support staff. But - it doesn't work correctly."	846
85	5	2017-10-30T00:00:00Z	"**Update** - Sometimes all you need to do is ask...in this case I didn't even need to do that. The support team was proactive about asking me if I needed help, and all I needed to do is give them temporary access to my Shopify store and the completed the setup.  So far, this app and the support I have received have been exemplary! 

It seems like it will do what I need, however the setup process involved a signficant number of steps and time constraints have prevented me from completing the setup.

Ron Myers"	847
85	5	2017-10-23T00:00:00Z	Great app, very easy to use and manage. Amazing support by Bold team for the customization of the app in our store. A special thank to Fred and Raj at Bold for their patience and full understanding of our customization requirements.	848
85	1	2017-10-18T00:00:00Z	This app is the worst thing that ever happened to us and our customers!! It is so buggy and honestly, should not be allowed in the Shopify developer ecosystem. Specific issues: the recurring billing is buggy. It fails to bill customers when it should. It doesn't show images for certain items loaded. It is tedious to manage - requires items are entered individually - try doing that for hundreds of items with variants which are treated as separate items. The box item selections are confusing. We never know what to expect. We should have known to stay away when the installation was problematic in the first place. If you value your customers and business, please stay away from this app. We are going back to the app we used previously (recharge). Let's not talk about the financial cost Bold has had on our business in terms of customer recovery.	849
85	5	2017-10-17T00:00:00Z	"Just built our Shopify site!  And installed Recurring Orders & Subscription Box App; my first point of support was Raj, who walked me through the pros and cons of switching from a membership model to a subscription - he sent me support docs and we decided on Recurring Orders & Subscription Box.

We are a patient education publisher and for 15 years licensed directly to hospitals... now we want to license to the 800k physicians in USA and Canada.

The issue with the Recurring Orders we had was that the BOX. for us needed to be pre-built w/pre-filled units - the ""selection"" area is an awesome client feedback of what's licensed in the box. We contacted BOLD and got the ""we can do"" answer and met Morgan! Well between our building the site, some site template issues and yes, CEO incompetence - Morgan built and re-built a script that achieved our special needs. Shoutout- thanks to Morgan for his effort and spirit.

We are less than 7 days out yet feel confident in running our first Facebook campaign knowing that the site is sound and that BOLD is available behind the scenes with a smart and nice support team. Thank you again, Raj and Morgan!

Best,

John Samellas, CEO MedSelfEd, Inc

86	5	2017-10-16T00:00:00Z	"Using Recurring Orders by Bold was one of the easiest steps in starting my subscription service. The stress I had put upon myself to figure out how to bill customers on a monthly (and other increments) basis was totally unnecessary. Within minutes, I had solved my biggest issue by simply downloading the app and having it installed on my site. Bold has been such a huge time-saver in starting my business, maintaining orders and payments, and keeping the wheels moving!

For starters, I haven't had to really utilize the support team- which is a great thing! I only had one question during setup that ended up being a coding issue on my site and not with the app. My inquiry through the Bold support team was addressed pretty immediately, which allowed me to coordinate with the coding issue."	851
86	5	2017-10-16T00:00:00Z	"Bold works Great! 
And the customer service team is one of the best ones I've ever encountered. They are very customer oriented and Raj and Morgan really went out of their way to solve my customization need ASAP. They not only fixed what I needed but they actually developed a way for me implement this myself whenever I needed it in new product for example and/or to remove it if I ever wanted to. 

When I needed to ask some questions a couple of weeks latter Raj actually took my chat himself and remembered my store and what they had done to it 2 weeks prior. Im extremlly happy with BOLD service and specially with the extra effort Raj and Morgan put into helping me.

PS...for customers in Mexico Bold is THE ONLY SUBSCRIPTION SOLUTION that works with Mexican payment gateways."	852
86	5	2017-10-14T00:00:00Z	We finally launched our site with the amazing support of the Bold Apps team! Great app but even better support :)	853
86	5	2017-10-13T00:00:00Z	Great app!  Set up and forget about it.  They do the work for you.  Watch the money come in	854
86	5	2017-10-11T00:00:00Z	Great apps and quality customer service. Thanks!	855
86	4	2017-10-10T00:00:00Z	4 stars because i cancelled before implementing its service but i gave it 4 starts because their customer service is excellent...when sales and product line improves i WILL be reinstalling their app	856
86	5	2017-10-09T00:00:00Z	"I just started using y'all. We had a really successful Kickstarter campaign but unfortunately the 1500+ backers we had won't be auto-renewed. We tried setting up Shopify with PayWhirl after our Kickstarter but it was too ugly for our design-focused products. When I found y'all (via Shopify customer service) I immediately loved the amazing aesthetics of everything y'all do.

We're about to hit the launch button — but I'm already so excited about the way recurring products are going to be a game-changer for us. Thank you so much!

I got to hop on the phone with Brandon from y'all's team. He was willing to listen to my questions, talk through solutions — and even called me back when he found a BETTER solution than the one he's immediately given me."	857
86	2	2017-10-05T00:00:00Z	The app itself is good, but it made a lot of hardcoded changes to my theme files that were quite difficult to remove after I got rid of the app. Make a back-up before you download this app!!!	858
86	5	2017-10-05T00:00:00Z	"We love Recurring Orders from Bold. Easy to use, highly recommended, amazing.
The team at Bold Commerce is above and beyond! We couldn't be happier and more satisfied with the amount of support we received from them. Anytime we needed some customization the customer service / tech team was there to help. We cannot express how grateful we are to them, especially to Leanne and Brad! Thank you!"	859
86	5	2017-10-04T00:00:00Z	"Superb app! Great features and was able to customise it well to my needs which were relatively far from the ""default use case"". And for the pieces I had trouble customising I got superb support from the Bold team. Strong recommendation!"	860
87	5	2017-10-03T00:00:00Z	The app works great.  The reason for my five-star review is that the people on their support chat service are great.  When something isn't working like it should, they know what they're doing and they get it fixed.	861
87	5	2017-10-03T00:00:00Z	We use this app for our monthly subscription service. Recently I had an issue and had to contact customer service. They were super responsive and helpful with every question I had. I would use another app from them 100%	862
87	1	2017-10-02T00:00:00Z	worst app in the world, cost me 1000000	863
87	1	2017-09-30T00:00:00Z	"At first glance, everything seems to be working fine. BUT, there are some major issues you should take a look at before you start using Bold Recurring Orders.

1. Checkout process is a black box. You don't have a way to find our who interrupts the checkout process and why.
2. This is more critical! Bold changed something which broke triggering webhooks from Shopify. When you do things, you sometimes broke something, and that's fine. BUT, the issue is Bold support said I have to be in touch with Shopify reps to fix this!? Bold changed something which broke webhooks and they ask from their customer to deal this issue with Shopify!?!?

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!"	864

Couldn't get time scheduled for a phone call for over a week."	865
87	5	2017-09-28T00:00:00Z	Great so far.  I am honestly writing this review to say how great the customer support has been.  I just installed the app yesterday and was contacted right away by customer support.  I needed assistance installing the liquid code and they stepped right up and installed it quickly, with no issues that I have encountered so far.    They also sent emails with training material that made it super easy to understand how to work the app.  Brenden stayed in touch with me through the entire process, keeping me up to speed on what was happening.  Awesome support.  Now, on to selling subscriptions.  :)	866
87	5	2017-09-28T00:00:00Z	Really great so far! I've been asking Robb HEAPS of questions and he's been super patient with me and is really helping me with getting set up! Looking forward to getting it rolling in the next few days, but if Robb's support is anything to go by, it's going to be a great experience! Will update as I get further down the path..	867
87	5	2017-09-27T00:00:00Z	Brenden Porcher started helping me out 9/25/17 on a chat. Brenden was very knowledgeable about RO. Without wasting my time, Brenden suggested we set up a call for the following day. Brenden then took the time to book a call for me that was outside his normal call times. 9/26 I received my call from Brenden at the exact correct time, not a minute late. Brenden then proceeded to guide me through setting up the app with extreme patience, as I am not that tech savy. Brenden went above and beyond to have some higher ups check into the way we had set up the app and make sure everything looked and worked perfectly. Brenden then set up a call with me at a time convenient for me the following day 9/27. Again, Brenden went through some quick suggestions on things to add or change and before long everything was looking and working flawlessly. I am very pleased I had the privilege of working with Brenden Porcher and will for certain be reaching out to him direct if I ever need anything in the future! Also... you should give Brenden Million dollar bonus...just saying. thanks again Brenden Porcher, I really appreciate your awesome guidance and assistance!	868
87	5	2017-09-25T00:00:00Z	Recurring Orders as been a great addition to our store, www.manemanagement.com.  Our customers love the app even though they have no idea of the inner workings.  It just works seamlessly with our store!	869
87	5	2017-09-23T00:00:00Z	Awesome app! I use it on my clothing rental site and have not had any problems yet. Definitely recommend !!	870
88	5	2017-09-23T00:00:00Z	Easy set up. I do recommend this app.	871
88	5	2017-09-22T00:00:00Z	We were looking at an easy way to sell monthly boxes and this app really helped us achieve this easily. Clients can manage their rexurring orders easily and we can send products easily each months to clients.	872
88	5	2017-09-21T00:00:00Z	This app has been integral in our operations, and I am very happy upon discovering it 2 weeks before opening our online store! Set-up wasn't difficult. The customer service has been very helpful and responsive to all of my questions. I would highly recommend!	873
88	5	2017-09-20T00:00:00Z	The team at Bold Commerce has been absolutely sensational! Special mention to Leanne who has helped us from our first enquiry and throughout the entire installation and customisation process, not to mention answering our endless questions. The support received by the staff at Recurring Orders gave us confidence to use Bold Commerce's other Apps in the future if required. Well done guys!	874
88	5	2020-05-06T00:00:00Z	"Great customer service!
Great App! 

Thanks Samantha for all your help and advice with Subscriptions and Discounts."	875
88	5	2017-09-20T00:00:00Z	I had the pleasure of working with Brenden from TeamDream at Bold today and I could not be more pleased with our interaction.  Benden was engaging, knowledgeable and funny. He quickly helped me to update my complex theme so that it would work correctly with their recurring order product.  Of all the app companies we have used so far in our business, Bold Apps has proven to be a cut above the rest. Job well done!	876
88	5	2017-09-19T00:00:00Z	"We launched our website about 10 years ago and people have been asking for auto ordering since its inception.  We deliver to different routes weekly and bi-weekly. People have always commented that it is such a pain to try and remember  to put in orders.  We have tried emailing them each week, but people get busy and always forget. Some people will remember after the cutoff time and beg for their orders to be filled late. 

When we switched our website platform to Shopify, a customer of ours suggested looking into your app. This auto ordering system has truly helped us manage our business more effectively.  Customers are loving it!  We had 13 customers sign up just in the first week we launched it and almost 40 by the end of the first month.  As people put in late orders, they are more likely to sign up for the automated system as well as it gives us another tool to use for people to get their orders in on time.  We have had nothing but positive feedback on the system thus far.  We really like the different reports that anticipate the sales volumes as well as being able to add notes to their accounts and make changes for customers that may feel uncomfortable with the system."	877
88	5	2017-09-16T00:00:00Z	"We are in the process of setting up my store and most of the apps used are from Bold Apps. Our website needs many customizations even with some of the Bold Aps (mostly with recurring orders). As a result, I don't even remember how many annoyable tickets we have created. All of those tickets always resolved not only on time but with other possible solutions provided if some modifications cannot be done in the nearest future. 
The support team is very responsive and probably the best on the whole Shopify marketplace. 
The other thing which is most favorable is that you can install almost any app and enjoy it for free for 30 days….even for 60-90 days in some cases. This gives you enough time to understand all the features and make all necessary website adjustments.
Wish Bold team to keep the same highest level of service and quality of their apps.
As was said above, the Bold app mostly used in our store is Recurring Orders&Subscriptions. Great App and easy to use. If you need a light customisation for your store it was done very quickly for us. Looking forward when the team launches open access API for this app in order to be integrated with other apps more flawlessly."	878
88	5	2017-09-15T00:00:00Z	I've been using Bold for a couple of months - setting up but have not gone live yet. It can be a little confusing at first, as with setting up any complex apps, there will be a bit of a learning curve. But I have to say the customer support has been excellent. The team is responsive, very friendly and knowledgeable. If I have a problem, the support team has always helped me resolve the issue. You can email them if you have an issue and they reply pretty quickly (sometimes within 10 mins), but if you have an urgent issue, you can even ask for a call-back, which many smaller apps on Shopify does not provide. So far so good!	879
88	5	2017-09-13T00:00:00Z	"I am just getting started with Bold products but I am loving the customer support and looking forward to many years of being a Bold customer.

The support team answered quickly even in the evening when I have had to wait days for responses from other companies. I appreciate the attentiveness. Thank you!"	880
89	5	2017-09-13T00:00:00Z	Big shout-out to Team Dream at BOLD.  We had a few minor issues arise when installing the app due to our theme being customized.  They jumped on chat immediately to respond to our q's and had integration specialists work on our theme immeidately to fix the problem and get us live.  Definitely recommend BOLD's app's to any store owner looking for solid follow-up service when needed.	881
89	5	2017-09-12T00:00:00Z	I would highly recommend this app to anyone considering integrating it into their online store. Not only is it easy to implement on the back end (took me about 3 days!), its extremely customer friendly on the front end. Our customers don't hesitate to reach out to let us know they are having a hard time with new features on the site (i.e. subscriptions) and we have received very few questions so far and seen great success with the app. Their customer service is fantastic (thanks, Leanne!)! We just installed two more apps from this group, I can't wait to work with them more in the future!	882
89	5	2017-09-11T00:00:00Z	Awesome customer service. app works great!	883
89	5	2017-09-09T00:00:00Z	Easiest app for reoccurring orders that I've found so far. good customer service. thank you	884
89	5	2017-09-08T00:00:00Z	Great app and awesome customer service.	885
89	5	2017-09-07T00:00:00Z	The team at Bold was extremely helpful in helping us make a switch from Recharge to their recurring app. Any questions that I had (and I had many) were answered within a few hours if not within minutes. The customer service team is very prompt to respond to any issues and have always been able to resolve any issues we have had fairly quickly as well.	886
89	5	2017-09-07T00:00:00Z	James and Robb were a huge help to our site!!!!! James helped us switch over from ReCharge because it was an absolute distaster. He made the transition seamless and was extremely responsive! We absolutely loved him!! Robb was professional, very knowledgeable and since we're not familiar with coding he explained everything in a way that we understood. The Em and Liz team cannot express how grateful we are to James, Morgan, Robb and the Bold team!! We love Bold!	887
89	5	2017-09-07T00:00:00Z	Super great app, easy to use and support is top notch. Thanks	888
89	5	2017-09-06T00:00:00Z	Great app and great customer service!	889
89	1	2017-09-13T00:00:00Z	"Their code screwed up my theme, the way it delivers pictures on the product pages. Despite multiple assurance from BOLD that their code ""was uninstalled and could not possibly cause this issue"", it turned out it was their fault, and they had failed to remove all code. Very unprofessional! They left me high and dry and lied to me. See below email from shopify support. Shopify had to fix BOLD's mess.

Hi Christian,
Thank you for your ongoing patience while our team looked into the issue.
The Theme Support Team responded back to me saying that it was in fact Bold's code that was causing the issue. They have commented out their code here: https://breadvillage.myshopify.com/admin/themes/184364488?key=sections/product-template.liquid&line=180 meaning that it should be working as intended now.
This might now cause the app not to work as intended. Theme Support has suggested that you will need to either revert your product-template.liquid file back to the beginning and use another app or reach out to Bold for more help. I'm honestly not sure myself how these things work, so I'm not sure how the Bold Team missed this, but I'm sure they might like to know in case it happens again.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
Thanks and have a good one.

90	5	2017-09-02T00:00:00Z	Love this app. Works exactly how I need it to. They installed it for me promptly and the whole experience was so easy for someone like me who does not understanding coding at all. I highly recommend it.	891
90	5	2017-09-01T00:00:00Z	The customer support/tech support alone deserves 5 stars -- I'd give 10 if that was an option. They are nothing short of amazing. (I really wish Bold launched even more apps because of the support team alone). As for Recurring, it's amazing. Seamless integration and works as promised. And anytime I want to make a customization to the subscription widget on our page, the customer service and tech team is there to help. I'm a huge a fan...clearly.	892

I am the CEO/Founder of Wealthy Minds.  I appreciate my dear friend Brenden at Bold.  This man is truly just amazing.  We never meet in person but I feel like we are friends.  Brenden's customer service is truly amazing and he helps me to understand everything about using this new bold app.  

I appreciate Brenden and all of you guys at Bold because you are helping us to speak our dreams into existence.  Together we are changing the world and inspiring more people to live their dreams.

Thank each of you at Bold.  Continue to do what you are doing because it may be a app to you but it is helping people to transform their lives from a negative to a positive.  I love this app, love your customer service, and everything.  I speak into existence that one day Bold will be a sponsor for Wealthy Minds.  

I can see and envision the day I'm doing a speech sponsored by Bold encouraging people to be BOLD and SPEAK THEIR DREAMS INTO EXISTENCE!

90	5	2017-08-31T00:00:00Z	Tried 3 different recurring/subscription apps, Bold's was the easiest to configure, personalize, and get up and running. Support's responses to our questions were quick and friendly. Highly recommend.	894
90	5	2017-08-31T00:00:00Z	"Bold's subscription app gave us a simple, non-branded, and minimalist way to offer our customers subscriptions. This allowed our customers to use our product consistently, which is important for them to experience the best results.

Bold's support team is friendly, quick, knowledgable, and easy to work with!"	895
90	5	2017-08-30T00:00:00Z	We love this app! So many of my customers are delighted with the ability to subscribe to our products. Easy to customize, and 100% AMAZING customer support. Use it!	896
90	5	2017-08-30T00:00:00Z	We love this application and our customers do too!	897
90	5	2017-08-28T00:00:00Z	I cannot recommend Leanne/Bold enough.  She was patient and very prompt in answering my questions of set up.  This is VERY rare with software, #1 to talk to a live person, #2 that we are offered 30 minute install confirmation and #3 to go the extra mile by enhancing the software.  It was a great experience thank you Leanne!	898
90	5	2017-08-24T00:00:00Z	I have to say that we have had an incredible experience using the Bold Recurring app on our store. We have been migrating our existing store over to Shopify and it you sell a product you must get this app. We do 60% of our business now through recurring orders while our competitors without have to constantly chase their customers to come back. It is totally worth the money to use a recurring order for your product. The customer service is the absolutely the best in the industry and we highly recommend them. They are fast and responsive to any issue we have had with site setup and changes we requested. I cannot say enough about how much time I have saved with their Live Chat and emailing them to get our problems solved quickly.	899
90	5	2017-08-23T00:00:00Z	"Great App!  I run a subscription business and we needed a few extra functionalities and the team were such a great help.  
App offers so many options and functionalities it is really fantastic. Interface takes a bit of getting used to, as you would expect with a new system that has got so many options, but once you have got the hang of it it is really seamless and straightforward. 
The service from the team is really stellar, they have done quite a few liquid adjustments as we don't know how to code and are really friendly and helpful."	900
91	1	2017-08-22T00:00:00Z	"Sent numerous emails to bold, they never reply...

Plus their phone support is literally nonexistent..."	901
91	5	2017-08-21T00:00:00Z	"Set up and migration was super easy with their support and we have had zero problems since started. 

We are saving money and looking forward to using some of the new functionality available to us."	902
91	5	2017-08-17T00:00:00Z	"We have only had this app for the shortest of times, but already we have our first recurring orders customer. 

We got the app because we really want to reward our most loyal customers with a discount. At the same time, knowing what's coming really helps us manage our stock and our cashflow.

I really look forward to more lovely subscription customers!"	903
91	3	2017-08-14T00:00:00Z	Very slow installation process. We have multiple sites using bold commerce and I feel they do not have enough staff to support their growth. Been waiting almost 5 days (3 business days)	904
91	5	2017-08-13T00:00:00Z	Excellent app and customer service.	905
91	5	2017-08-09T00:00:00Z	This app is well designed, functional, and easy to use. Bold support has been fantastic throughout!	906
91	5	2017-08-01T00:00:00Z	So far I've been super impressed with the customer service I have received. Morgan Wowk and his team have reworked my custom subscription builder several times to get it how I want it (I've been picky). The price they quoted me to make this custom page was very fair compared to other quotes I received. I'm very happy with the work they did and the timeliness of their responses.	907
91	5	2017-07-28T00:00:00Z	So glad we went with BOLD! We were a little nervous about launching our subscription product, but their team educated us SO much about what we needed to do to run smoothly.  Their team is SO patient and well informed.  I FEEL LIKE A PRO NOW!	908
91	5	2017-07-28T00:00:00Z	Easy to use and seems support is always available if needed.	909
91	5	2017-07-24T00:00:00Z	Great support team and very helpful with all of the setup and questions we had. The recurring orders in our online store have been slowly rolling in but it's worth it for the future income the app helps guarantee. I would recommend this app to anyone.	910
92	5	2017-07-20T00:00:00Z	The assistance i received from Robb and his team was impeccable. He was always kind, and honest on how long things would take, he talked me through setting things up and helped me get everything up and running smoothly. Thank you for all your help!	911
92	5	2017-07-17T00:00:00Z	"Brilliant results and lots of additional functionalities on the website that have increased significantly customers' engagement. 

Real great customer service support too. Thank you Bold!"	912
92	5	2017-07-24T00:00:00Z	Installation was done by Bold in a fantastic turn around time. Then as I contacted them for further support on my part, the customer care was impeccable, extremely caring, and I could not be happier with the results. Planning to use more of their apps in the future and I highly recommend them to anyone. Thank you guys for your support and care.	913
92	5	2017-07-15T00:00:00Z	Bold has the best customer support ever!	914
92	5	2017-07-15T00:00:00Z	So far so good. I received my first subscription after installing this app. The install was easy and it works well. Definitely, check out this app.	915
92	5	2017-07-14T00:00:00Z	"The Bold Recurring Orders App has revolutionized the way I conduct my business. I run a business that allows customers to create custom multipacks of fitness and nutrition bars on a subscription model.  After launch, I had a few months of very low sales. I realized that a lot of my issues were due to a poor user interface which created roadblocks for the customer to complete their purchase. Having little to no coding experience myself, I began reaching out to developers to get quotes on building an easier to use UI. As the quotes began rolling in, I quickly became demoralized due to the high cost and large amount of time that would be needed to implement the changes I had visualized. As I was on the precipice of determining what was next for me and my site, I discovered The Recurring Orders Build a Box functionality!  As I learned more about the feature I had to ask if I was dreaming because it included everything that I had visualized for my site!  This out of the box solution makes it easy for my customers to customize their own subscription box while presenting the details of each box option to make their decisions that much easier. I can easily say that Bold has saved me thousands of dollars, not to mention weeks of work, that I otherwise would have spent working with a developer.  Bold has given me a site that I am truly proud of and excited to say that I am a part of.  I don't know if my site would still be around today if it weren't for Bold and the Recurring Orders team.

Working with the Bold support team has been seamless! When I originally made the switch to begin using the Build a Box function, I struggled to get the correct options to show up.  I reached out to the support team late Friday night, not expecting a response until the next week, but to my surprise someone reached back out to me on Saturday and got my ticket moving.  Early Monday morning I was contacted again and was told that I was using an old version of liquid which was preventing the new functionality from working.  The support rep took it upon himself to update all of my code to the newest version and I was good to go before I would have even expected a first reply from any other customer service team.  Over the next few days I encountered a couple of (probably very basic) liquid issues, and the support team took the time to coach me through the changes I was looking to make - offering service which was above and beyond what I expected of them.  Overall, the support team created a very memorable experience and left me to walk away proud and excited for what's next in the evolution of my business!"	916
92	5	2017-07-14T00:00:00Z	"Being able to offer subscriptions of my products to my customers is a game changer for my business. My typical buyer buys 1.5x, with the Bold Subscription App, my goal is now to increase that by 200%. That is a game changer.

I had very specific styling requirements for the Subscription Widget. One email to Robb, and bam! they knocked it out. I couldn't believe I wasn't charged for all the fantastic work they did."	917
92	5	2017-07-11T00:00:00Z	Their team was diligent and resourceful in helping through a complex problem. Thanks!	918
92	5	2017-07-25T00:00:00Z	Support is excellent and they helped me to resolve any issues that have arisen so far.  Recommend!	919
92	5	2017-07-11T00:00:00Z	thank you for the quick response./	920
93	5	2017-07-20T00:00:00Z	thank you for the fast response	921
93	4	2017-07-07T00:00:00Z	This is a great option for implementing a continuity program in your store.  We uploaded it as soon as we opened, and it did not work.  The basic math shows that you should have a good number of customers (and repeat customers) before offering something like this makes sense (for physical products anyways).  A year later, we came back to this app and are very pleased.	922
93	5	2017-07-05T00:00:00Z	The BEST recurring app available on the market! I have been a Bold customer for about 3 years now, and they do a phenomenal job in managing my recurring subscriptions. Their app is uber user friendly, and whenever I have questions on anything, their response time is within a couple of hours. Robb helped out today with an issue I wasn't even aware of and could have potentially cost me a lot of money. He not only fixed the issue quickly, but he updated the widget so that I no longer come across this issue in the future! I would give 6 stars if I could! :) THE BEST PRODUCT AND SERVICE.	923
93	5	2017-07-05T00:00:00Z	This app does so many different things and I have only begun to use it but I really like the app because it allows my store to be more flexible for the customer.  The technical team is on the ball and responds quickly to questions.  The chat team knows their stuff and if they don't they know what to do to get it done.  I have been talking with someone from each group for the last couple of days as they helped me build my app and they have always been positive and courteous.  I really enjoyed working with them and would recommend them to anyone who can use bold recurring orders and subscriptions.	924
93	5	2017-07-04T00:00:00Z	If I had the option to rate more stars I would. I can't even begin to explain how helpful, fast, and thorough everyone that I worked with was. I had lots of customization to my site,  back and forths, updates, and exporting data from one platform to another, and everything was taken care of, and taken care of quickly. I'm so glad that I went with Recurring Orders & Subscriptions by Bold. The customer service really is the best that I've seen, and Im not exaggerating. Not only was everything I asked for (and it was a lot), taken care of quickly, but everyone was so nice and incredibly helpful!! Everyone at the team, I thank you so much!!!	925
93	5	2017-06-28T00:00:00Z	"I run an existing subscription business with thousands of subscribers on a custom-built platform. That sounds great but when you're responsible for when things break, your developers become unreliable or any host of other issues, it's a real bummer. So, for my second business, I wanted to try something where the fundamentals are taken care of by other people and I could plug in best-of-breed applications to deliver the functionality I wanted vs having to build it from scratch or deal with a messy integration. Essentially, leverage to enable me to spend my time developing products and customers. Obviously, the key functionality was the recurring subscriptions.

Bold Recurring Orders & Subscriptions, and I do not say this lightly, has more robust/clean functionality than we've been able to build internally. Their product expert support (I am looking at you, Victoria) is BETTER than what I get from my own team. Their Help Center documentation is probably the best I've ever read and incredibly easy to find my own answers and implement step-by-step. 

To say I'm impressed would be a massive understatement. Thank you again!!"	926
93	5	2017-06-27T00:00:00Z	"Hello Fellow Shopify Store Owners,

So, I initially downloaded the BOLD Recurring Order App and set up several aspects or features, most notable are the subscription groups of course... I really love these... I have two on my website, www.MarqueeCandles.com... one group is set up for customers to purchase individual candles on a recurring order - subscription basis... or they can purchase an individual candle all on its own, the widget is AWESOME.. it looks just like the ""One Time Purchase"" or ""Subscription"" option you might see on Amazon.com.. So, I love it.. as this is a feature that potential customers are familiar with. 

Secondly, i set up another group for a product which has Subscription as the only offering to customers.. Both groups work seamlessly...the widgets on the product pages are brilliant.. I say that because i love the fact that you can customize the look with color attributes and line color and much more... Both groups work smoothly when checking out... you can have both; subscription purchased items in the shopping cart, as well as individual -one time purchased items in the cart... 

Another thing, the Recurring Orders App requires you to designate the merchant account you want to use to process the order... I set up the BrainTree account (which by the way is a subsidiary of Paypal so its a trusted merchant service provider), but i ultimately decided to use the Stripe merchant account for checkout processing of Recurring Subscription Orders as it simply deposits monies into my business checking account... so it works just fine for me that way. But now i have the option of changing to BrainTree if I ever want to... The App also offers access or integration with a plethora of other merchant providers, most I don't know anything about... 

Anyway, another aspect I like about this App is that you can offer customers Discount codes. As you know you can create discounts in your Shopify store, but you can also offer customers Discount codes you create in the Recurring Orders App... and the beauty is that the two different discount codes do not overlap... meaning the Shopify discount codes will not be recognized and honored if someone enters one at checkout if the same code is not set up in the Recurring Orders App... At first this might sound like its a Negative against the App but its not....because think about it this way.. in your regular store you may offer discount codes or promotions for individual items... say 10% off a candle we sell, but since we are offering subscriptions to customers which already contain discounts, we don't want the customer to be able to take an additional 10% off of the already discounted subscription price.. so this is Genius if you ask me... It gives you total control over the pricing, the discounts and keeping what you offer customers separate... 

Now, there was one issue I thought I HAD with this App which turned out to be false... so this may help to know too... but i need to first preface it with this statement.. i am not an Internet SEO guru okay? I am good at it to a point but i have limits and I say this because I ran a speed test on my site after loading this App and three others to my store... and Pingdom and GTMetrix both gave my site a Lower than average Grade for Website load time. When I first researched the reasons, some of them included the following: Downloads across hostnames, then there were Combine External JavaScript mentions, then there were Remove query strings mentions... Sooooo....thinking the BOLD App and the other Apps were the problem... what did I do... I uninstalled all of them believing this will fix my website load time... WELL.... here is where the wake up call comes in... I re-ran the tests and guess what there was only nominal improvement in my site load speed... i discovered, that had i taken more time to look at the analysis i would have found the first time that my biggest issue was not the BOLD App or other Apps at all but rather the file size of my photos on the site and the need to serve photos at an already smaller size so the CSS script or whatever it is doesn't have to shrink them, thereby forcing the load time to be longer because the code has to execute a command to shrink a photo before loading a website when called upon on the internet... 

Soooo... HUGE lesson learned here... because I loved the BOLD APP.... ENTER.. My Re-Installation  =0) 

I then reinstalled the Recurring Orders & Subscription App and had a minor tweek that needed to be adjusted over Father's day weekend, so i submitted a ticket to BOLD... and thought I would not hear back until Monday or Tuesday. Well, guess what.... Not only did I hear back from the BOLD App staff, i got an immediate fix from Raj.... ( Raj you are the MAN! ) Thanks again for your dedication and help over that weekend... He fixed my issue in no time at all and responded to me immediately. Then on Monday another team member from Bold addressed the Ticket as follows up to make sure it was all working... 

I really cant say enough good things about my experience with this BOLD App and its designers or staff members... Probably the biggest take aways for you, my fellow Shopify store owners, are these two points.... 

1. This App works GREAT... and it has tons of other features like Analytics, Reports, Recurring Cart Orders,  Build-A-Box (which I love as this will fit with another business I have), Manage Customers with recurring orders, Manage Products - which will give you a forecast of the inventory you need in the future to cover subscriptions, plus even though I'm not using it, you can set up Discounts in the Bold App which are not offered in your actual Shopify store discount system as I mentioned above.

2. The second most important take away is this... CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT RESPONDS... yes its in Caps because i want to emphasize this... we have all downloaded Apps off the Shopify App Store only to discover a product that is faulty or we need help with installation and then WHAM.... there is no one there to help you.... Well, BOLD gets 10 stars in Customer Service not only because of my Father's Day weekend fix by Raj, but because BOLD will actually install the Recurring Order App in your store for you.. you just have to give them the limited access they need and BOOM they do it.. (Note here... I thought i could do the initial install on my own and got to step 7 and found out.. ""okay this part i cant do"") I contacted BOLD requesting help with my initial installation and within hours I had responses from Jordan, Leanne & Victoria.... They were on top of it and Jordan finished off the install and then i had a follow up from Brenden....

Guys.. (ie.. shopify store owners) I know all this sounds like overkill filled with praise, but its all true and happened just as I outlined it.. and lets be honest you are a consumer okay, a store owner in the Shopify App market, and as a consumer you are not just buying a product you expect to work but you are buying the service that supports it... and BOLD nails this on both levels.. my hats off to BOLD... and I don't say that lightly because I am a picky consumer... I will take a product back to a store in a minute if there is a problem with it or I will contact customer service if i need their advertised help.. and if i dont get it, i simply return the product and move on to the next guy willing to take my money who will give me what i want.. and that is why I am pleased with BOLD... I plan to add other Apps they have as my orders increase so the Apps can pay for themselves.. but at this time this is the one I have.. and it does what it is supposed to... My Thanks to Victoria, Jordan, Leanne, Raj and Brenden and your colleagues for a great Product and equally great Service.

I hope this was helpful to anyone considering this App... again i know its long but given the premium quality of the App and the Customer Service Bold provides this review is the least they deserve.

Have a good one and best of luck with your Shopify Store. I highly recommend using the Recurring Order App by BOLD if you have a need or desire to set up products for Recurring Orders/Subscriptions.

Kind Regards,
Chris

93	5	2017-06-26T00:00:00Z	We have recently started using this app, it was easy to set up, and whilst we only have one customer with a recurring order so far, it's seamless and working well!	928
93	5	2017-06-26T00:00:00Z	"We've been through a couple of Subscription style apps and I wish we'd found this one sooner. Initially we didn't use this app because it didn't have PayPal as a payment method but the other features that it DOES have more than make up for it. The support is excellent and I'm really happy to say that I think we've finally found our ""forever"" subscription app."	929
93	5	2018-11-27T00:00:00Z	I'm using the Recurring Order app and needed help understanding how to change some wording for a new recurring order product.  Support was so patient with me and helped me understand where in the app I could make the change myself.  I am very happy with the Recurring Order app and Bold!	930
94	5	2017-06-23T00:00:00Z	Morgan from support staff fully turned around our product and helped setup a very custom solution to our business. GREAT product and staff.	931
94	5	2017-06-22T00:00:00Z	"I really love using this Recurring Order & Subscriptions by Bold.  Why?
1] support by Bold staff turn around is always in a timely manner
2] as a first time end user, my experience with this app is very easy to learn its features and to follow clearly labeled menu screens with its features.
3] I still have a lot to learn about this app that I added to our Shopify store in June 2017. So, I can convert all manual process to online or paperless environment that is PCI compliant tied to credit card payments.  And I know BOLD staff is always there for help.

Thanks BOLD.
Marlene"	932
94	5	2017-06-17T00:00:00Z	I asked questions while setting up the app. Your team was very helpful and cheerful in answering my questions.	933
94	5	2017-06-17T00:00:00Z	very userfriendly and self explanatory app, fast responsive customer service, they help you to install the code and do it faster than they promise :) great job	934
94	5	2017-06-16T00:00:00Z	Wow I have used all the other recurring apps available on shopify and this is BY FAR THE BEST. They will always help with what ever is going on. Victoria is always available to get the job done super quick. I am so stoked with how affordable it is. I also love how it works with all their other stellar apps.	935
94	5	2017-06-13T00:00:00Z	This app has simply allowed recurring subscriptions on our store for our nutrition and fitness apps. We simply could not have sold our products without the use of this app. We loved the communication and help at every step along the launch of our store.	936
94	5	2017-06-09T00:00:00Z	This app does everything that I need. The backend admin side is intuitive and easy to follow. The convertible subscription feature is very nice. They have outstanding customer service and installation of the app was fairly straightforward. Even if you have problems customer service is very responsive.	937
94	5	2017-06-09T00:00:00Z	We are so glad that we are using the Bold Apps Recurring Orders app. We wanted to do a Sock of the Month Club and tried another app first that did not meet our needs. Our Sock of the Month Club is now a best seller for us. Bold Apps has been responsive to our questions and help us solve the inevitable glitches.  We highly recommend.	938
94	5	2017-06-08T00:00:00Z	We started Awebox a month ago, and so far have had an excellent experience with Bold. You have a fantastic range of apps, and with great help from your support team, we identified that your new Build a Box function in the Reccuring Orders app was perfect for what Awebox needed. Because the Build a Box function is so new, it's does have certain limitations, but on the whole it does what we need it to, and not only that but the support team have been more than helpful in helping us implement new functionality.	939
94	5	2017-06-07T00:00:00Z	"I was honestly really dubious about trying out Shopify. I am a bit of a control freak and without knowing code, it's hard for me to get the customization I want on my website. 

ENTER BOLD. This company and their incredible slew of apps have made the difference for me between feeling like an ecommerce idiot to at least *looking* like a pro with literally just a few clicks. 

I remember thinking it was going to take all this coding and research and money and blah blah to set up a subscription service for our herbal koffee product. 

NOPE. I clicked some buttons. They set it up for me (FREE, I might add). BOOM I was selling subscriptions. Like that!!

When I had a problem customer service was AWESOME. Fast and helpful and educational and patient. 

I really love Bold and find their apps so worth the money."	940
95	5	2017-06-06T00:00:00Z	"The Recurring Orders app has allowed my idea to become a real functioning business. I run a surfboard fin rental program using the app to complete the monthly subscription payments. After months of trawling through the other apps and platforms I contacted the Bold team who steered me to the Recurring Orders app and I haven't looked back. I was almost about to give up on my concept until I found it and am stoked that I did.
Thank you Bold!
I wanted to change some of the options the members could access in their account but could not find an option to do so from the app manager. I emailed the Bold team who replied super fast and confirmed what I wanted to do. Within a day, the changes had been passed onto the app developers and completed for me. It was unreal and the service was amazing!"	941
95	5	2017-06-05T00:00:00Z	I do like the app and will keep it. I really like the support also from Bold, definitely the most actively helpful I've had. As a result I have 3 Bold apps on my store (not sure if this is a lot to you but you're the only company I have multiples of).	942
95	5	2017-06-03T00:00:00Z	It's been truly a great experience with the team. I get the impression they are of the mindset 'How can we help to alleviate the workload so that business owners can focus on what's more important'. That to me, is priceless.	943
95	5	2017-06-02T00:00:00Z	"I started using this app for a client and initially found it challenging and a little confusing BUT with the latest upgrades and using this app directly with Shopify it's frictionless.  The flexibility is just enough to allow customization while locked down enough for ease of use. 
I highly recommend BOLD ad s partner app to Shopify."	944
95	4	2017-05-30T00:00:00Z	"Bold Recurring Orders & Subscriptions has been a great addition to our Shopify store. From the back end it is very easy to use and gives you all the information you could want. I've rated the app only 4 stars for the following reasons.

(1) Bold performed the install and didn't properly test to make sure the code worked with our shops theme. This resulted in iOS users not being able to check out and purchase and took a couple of days to deduce the problem. However they worked with us to find a mutual resolution to this problem.

(2) Customizing the look and feel of the check out and order confirmation emails can be a little cumbersome but not the worst. 

(3) It is a personal pet peeve of mine when Shopify Apps say $19.99/month and then in the fine print mention that they take 1% of the order value. Not to mention that Bold only makes the 1% known on their website and not the Shopify App store website. This is annoying and if your app is good enough you shouldn't worry about the 1% people will inevitably use it if it adds value.

If you want a subscription service definitely choose Bold Commerce. It isn't perfect but its the best you're going to get and with the right questions/requests you'll get it up and running without a hitch."	945
95	5	2017-09-13T00:00:00Z	This is easy to use, the support team is amazing and customers really like the option to have recurring orders.  The app automates the entire process while at the same time allowing the customer to edit, manage, delete as they would like.   www.ScalisiSkincare.com	946
95	5	2017-05-28T00:00:00Z	We have had a coffee subscription in place for a few years now however this was always a very manual process. Customers would have to pay for their subscription upfront (3 months, 6 months or 12 months) through our online store, set up as a standard product in Shopify. Then from there we would have to manually enter this into our database, send out a welcome email, last order email etc. Now that we have Bold, this is all automated, saving us time and making our coffee subscription process a whole lot more efficient. It also gives our customers the option to pay fortnightly, meaning less of an upfront cost for them, and generally just more flexibility on their end. Essentially, we love Bold	947
95	4	2017-05-28T00:00:00Z	"Good.
But the Add to existing Order button is often hidden."	948
95	5	2017-05-27T00:00:00Z	The app is great and the customer service is the best I've ever experienced!	949
95	5	2017-05-24T00:00:00Z	Holy Cow.  Honestly.  One of the best customer service experiences ever.  They respond really fast to emails and they nicely installed the bold liquid code for us.  Highly recommended.	950
96	3	2017-05-24T00:00:00Z	"I would rate this higher because it is easy to use and affordable but 2 things..... 

1. There are bugs in the app around data capture when a user signs up & the app charging the customer when you requested to ""skip"" charging the customer for the next subscription. This was a huge nightmare when you have 500 subscribers. 

2. It is always a chore to get someone on the phone."	951
96	5	2017-05-21T00:00:00Z	It has been great for my needs. And they've given great customer service!	952
96	5	2017-05-19T00:00:00Z	"Recurring Orders

My store sells pocket notebooks. Simple little books for your pocket. Not the most expensive commodity in the world, but dear to those who love them.
Recurring orders allows customers to control their own purchasing pattern and spend. They are in charge. 
Leaving me to go find more new cool notebooks and customers.
:-)

The support team at Bold are patient. I'm not that tech-savvy. Support translate my analogue questions into digital, implement the answer and then explain back to me in analogue how it works."	953
96	5	2017-05-19T00:00:00Z	"We recently are moving several of our stores to Shopify and are using BOLD Recurring Apps. We would never be without this option as we have customers that have been on recurring orders for over 7 years. The value to you the client is a consistent revenue stream that adds up fast. Every time I get on a site for something I use on a regular basis... it saves me money. This app is great and easy to use. I love it and as soon as it was installed we had 2 recurring orders placed in the first week. We have one product and offer three options.... one is regular price, a single bottle recurring, and a three pack. The customer saves 25% on the monthly recurring order and even more on the 3 pack. All of this revenue compounds over time. Scroll down on this page to see a unique way of presenting 3 offers for the same product.

https://brlequine.com/pages/epoboost-endurance-and-performance-supplement

I also need to say that Bold Apps has an amazing support team. I have yet to experience this level of support through an email only support. It is exceptional.

Thanks Bold Apps!!!"	954
96	5	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	love it best app would not operate my store with out it	955
96	5	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	"Our entire model is based on recurring memberships. One thing that Bold Apps have allowed us to do is track monthly payments as well as when we should ship product as it isnt a 1 to 1 correlation in our model.

the support team has been amazing. Brad and Morgan have both helped immensely as we customize our interface and how we see when to ship products in the administrative view versus having to do so manually in a spreadsheet."	956
96	5	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	Great app! We've been using for a short while, but it has been seamless with our store. Support has been great too. The only thing I'd like to see added is a little more around the recurring checkout functionality (ex: ability to use PayPal Express and easier integration with Google Analytics ecommerce tracking).	957
96	5	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	"I LOVE this app. I sell a consumable product so this has helped my customer retention and best of all it's very easy. Easy to get started, easy for my customers to use and an ""easy"" boost for my monthly revenue.

I worked with the support team to get the app installed and they were quick, helpful and communicative. Couldn't have asked for a better experience!"	958
96	5	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	"Great App and very easy to use. Super friendly & very pro support team. They helped for the configuration of the app and even some configuration to I regrette it on my website. 
I definitely/strongly recommend this app for subscription. Very usuefull!"	959
96	5	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	"One word. Amazing..supportive..helpful....
ok so three words."	960
97	2	2017-05-15T00:00:00Z	I think I would really like bold but I can't reach anyone for help.  Probably the scariest thing is if its always going to be like this.	961
97	5	2017-05-15T00:00:00Z	We love the recurring orders and subscriptions app.  Once it is set up, it takes care of itself.  We have had great reviews from customers about how easy it is to use, and it's also very easy on our end of things.	962
97	4	2017-05-14T00:00:00Z	Allowing us a 90 day trial of the app is very helpful. You made the installation quickly and your support team is very responsive.  A bug was introduced during the installation, so I would suggest your team does a simple quality test to ensure the add to cart and checkout functions work as expected. My variant function was broken, so two of our orders went through and resulted in a customer complaint and loss of revenue for us.  That being said, the service is free, so no complaints from me.  These types of things are just the cost of conducting biz.  Thank you for your help.  I really appreciate the services you provide.	963
97	5	2017-05-12T00:00:00Z	"in fact always was trying to enhance our customer experience in somehow, i did a lot of research and studies regarding that part, until i read about your app and what it can do to enrich customer shopping experience  

by using your app the customer become able to get discounted price, comparing what he or she paying about 25$ for membership but getting 35% off on any order from our store, that lead for more loyalty and and more satisfied customer specially for those who buying on monthly basis, they saved a lot and on my side i guarantee the customer will buy from my store again because he paid the membership fees

support is my main concern when i choosing a service or app provider because without support you could loss a lot, the support team helped me a lot from the point i started the app installation to configuring and customizing the app with some tweak that i like to enhance store experiment, i can say one thing only i love you guys keep such good work :)"	964
97	3	2017-05-12T00:00:00Z	"I like the app.  It gets a 4.8.

I utter am sick to death of the pushes to review, check ins, tidal waves of emails and the push push push making sure everything is great.  Insecure much?  They have it dialed up to 11 and I hate it. That gets a 1.  You can have too much of a good thing folks."	965
97	5	2017-05-10T00:00:00Z	BOLD themselves are very helpful and responsive, I have no complaints on them. The user interface could be improved, but it does the job. We pretty much use the recurring order app in its most basic form, but I feel there is room for improvement. I have no regrets with this app :) I tried other competitor recurring billing apps, since BOLD was the first to reply they were the first ones I tested and haven't dropped them since.	966
97	5	2017-05-10T00:00:00Z	"We run a children education subscription box business and a powerful programme allowing us to do recurring payments is a must! Based on our past experience with other BOLDapps, we knew we were getting uncompromising quality and something that works seamlessly.  The app does everything it promises to - schedule our orders, recurring payments (with STRIPE - great for cashflow because the money gets transferred back) and the backend is powerful enough for us to reschedule subscription plans.  Our site is up and running in 1 week without glitches so we've got no complaints!

Support team is really awesome!  I've had a few queries that weren't covered in their FAQs.  Upon emailing the support team, I've got my answer in less than 1 working day, solving all my technical problems.  

I love that we don't just get 1 version of the app for better or worse.  The team constantly gives upgrades which show their commitment to making things work better for everyone.  Thanks and keep up the good work!"	967
97	5	2017-05-06T00:00:00Z	This is the APP. Get it. We did, spent a little time planning how to execute and now we have make over 15K on the first day of the month all while driving loyal clients back to our site all month long. It's easy to set up and well worth a quick strategy session to implement the BOLD RO App into your model. Well done team!	968
97	5	2017-05-02T00:00:00Z	"I own a meal prep company. Many of my clients order the same foods week to week, and their orders never change. It became a major hassle for them to remember to order every week so I found myself ""chasing"" orders every week.

It was a hassle for them. It was a major waste of energy for me and I had little time to spend marketing to increase outreach. 

Bold has not only become a convince for all my clients it has become a selling feature for new clients. I'm able to offer a discount for the subscription and my customer feel they are rewarded for there loyalty. 

It's a huge win win. Thank You.

I had the app installed incorrectly and my clients weren't able to change values in the shopping cart. All of my orders are due by Friday each week, so friday's are a busy sales day for me. This install issue was a major problem on a busy friday. 

Not only did they answer my phone, Bold already knew who they were talking to and they were able to correct the issues while i was on the phone. LIFESAVER!!!

Best,

Amanda"	969
97	5	2017-05-01T00:00:00Z	Great App, Great Customer Service!	970
98	5	2017-04-30T00:00:00Z	Extremely powerful app and top notch customer support. Victoria was able to get our company out of a bind and personally got us up and running within an hour. A+ company and customer service!	971
98	3	2017-04-30T00:00:00Z	Please. For the love of god. Remove the request to comment and leave feedback popup. It's a UI nightmare	972
98	5	2017-04-29T00:00:00Z	Excellent product - easy to use :)	973
98	5	2017-04-27T00:00:00Z	"This app is really powerful and is loaded with tons of awesome features. The best part is the Bold support team, they are super quick to respond and are always very helpful.

It's a bit daunting starting a subscription service and trusting apps or app providers with my business. What I quickly learned was that the team at Bold isn't just an app company that wants my money. They are an epic team that cares about their product and the success of my business. I tried other subscription apps and only ended up disappointed with the lack of features."	974
98	5	2017-04-26T00:00:00Z	great app works fantastic.Great for free trail then re bill offers.	975
98	5	2017-04-26T00:00:00Z	Great product, constantly evolving and making themselves better, and 1st rate support.  Would recommend this product to anyone!	976
98	5	2017-04-25T00:00:00Z	Excellent app!  Very easy to install.  Support staff has been fantastic as well.  I highly recommend added this to your store!	977
98	4	2017-04-24T00:00:00Z	"I've been using this app for a few weeks now and I love what it's doing for me. It was so easy to set up and I'm already getting orders. It's really awesome seeing what the projected revenue for the year is going to be and I can see this really helping me better understand that lifetime value of my customers.
Sure, I'll do that :-) press ENTER"	978
98	1	2019-09-13T00:00:00Z	"its buggy at times but overall works well. support team has been helpful too
(April 2017)

Honestly have at least one problem with Bold a week.  I feel like we're losing customers every time because it is a problem for the customer. Not seamless.
(Sep 2019)"	979
98	5	2017-04-24T00:00:00Z	Great app where you can manage different payment plans in your products or in a variant in specific. Great customer service and good communication. Deserve 5 stars...	980
99	5	2017-04-24T00:00:00Z	I transferred from one subscription app to Bold and Victoria was nothing short of amazing during the transfer of my current subscribers. I had a ton of questions that were all answered in a timely fashion. I would not hesitate to recommend Bold Apps to anyone.	981
99	4	2017-04-24T00:00:00Z	Would be five star if it would support recurring payment by email invoices.	982
99	4	2017-05-18T00:00:00Z	This app works perfectly and allows my customers to continue their journey of a healthier lifestyle without the hassle of remembering to order products when they are getting low.  The support team were fantastic during setup, which is really easy to do.  This app works so well I have never had to contact them again :)	983
99	5	2017-04-20T00:00:00Z	Great! Resourceful and responsive! Really well thought out!	984
99	5	2017-04-17T00:00:00Z	Recurring Orders & Subscriptions is a great app. Intuitive and easy to implement.	985
99	5	2017-04-17T00:00:00Z	Great app, easy integration and very simple to use!	986
99	5	2017-04-16T00:00:00Z	Seemless and Simple. Love the Bold App.	987
99	1	2017-04-15T00:00:00Z	I'm fed up with this app. It does not display the subscription option on the product page for all the variants for a product. I also can't see which products are already added to a subscription so I'm lost on what I've added and what I haven't. Support is also spotty. I need another solution unless they can get it together. I do see that lots of people love the app so apparently it works well for some. But my experience has been frustrating and kind of terrible.	988
99	5	2017-04-13T00:00:00Z	Great CS and easy integration!	989
99	3	2017-04-11T00:00:00Z	"Good app, but has major flaws for our business due to the non-integration of Shopify coupons. (Shopify won't give them access to the coupon API). We have hundreds of loyalty coupons that are generated for our loyal customers, but they cannot use them on subscription orders. 

If that's not an issue for you...this app works great!

Another major customer complaint was that no additional (non-subscription) products could be added to subscription orders."	990
100	5	2017-04-10T00:00:00Z	Thanks for your app. It has been great! Keep up the good work.	991
100	5	2017-04-10T00:00:00Z	"Bold RO works great! After using another app for a few years we mage the switch over to the Bold RO and can not figured out why we did not sooner. 

This app DOES NOT create hidden products with a discount like other apps and management is super easy. Customer management is easy and most important seeing your upcoming orders and estimated revenue is is very clear.

Bold Reoccurring orders is the best choice that is available."	992
100	5	2018-04-05T00:00:00Z	"We really like this App and how easy it makes having a subscription box!  Thank you!  
I wanted to add to this review to update it from a year ago and say that the support staff saved me today and went above and beyond! Specifically Morgan Wowk but I’m sure a lot of other behind the scenes people as well. They helped me fix a problem within hours that originally would have taken days! The emergency was my technical error and they still dropped everything to come to my rescue! I can’t say thank you enough! Great service and staff!"	993
100	5	2017-05-30T00:00:00Z	the best option so far.. by far! GREAT APP!	994
100	5	2017-04-08T00:00:00Z	Great service, and they got me up and at em very quickly.	995
100	5	2017-04-07T00:00:00Z	I love Bold! I have been using it for a little over a month. I had so many questions to start off and Victoria along with the Bold team has been a HUGE help in getting me up and running. Everything is very simple to use. I will be sticking with bold for a long time! Love their customer service.	996
100	5	2017-04-04T00:00:00Z	"This app has been second to none for Pounds Coffee! We focus on roasting craft coffees that everyone can enjoy at home, and the Recurring Orders app by Bold allows us to hang on to happy customers by giving them the option to set up flexible subscriptions. 

All of that is good, but truly the best part of this app, and all Bold apps, is the service that you receive from their entire team."	997
100	3	2017-03-30T00:00:00Z	Enjoying it so far but haven't had enough time to really see how this app works before launch. Review pop up keeps appearing so thought I would answer now to stop it popping up again (might be something to fix). So far so good.	998
100	5	2017-03-30T00:00:00Z	"Great app easy to use A+
Support was very quick to install and made sure it ran smoothly."	999
100	5	2017-03-29T00:00:00Z	Great app, works well and easy to use!	1000
101	5	2017-03-29T00:00:00Z	Great app for adding simple subscription capabilities to your store. Most notably, one of the best customer service/support experiences we've come across so far in Shopify. The direct access to developers & sales at all hours of the day sets a high bar for other apps. Shoutout to Robb, Morgan and the rest of the team.	1001
101	5	2017-03-28T00:00:00Z	"So far things have been great. I would and will continue to use Bold Apps simply for their incredible customer service. Seriously these guys are awesome and super responsive. The app is easy to use and seems to be working well. I've only been open a short time so it has not been hit with a ton of traffic but from what I have already seen its working great! 

Kepp it up Bold. Y'all rock!"	1002
101	5	2017-03-28T00:00:00Z	After much frustration with Shopify for not caring enough to make subscriptions native to their platform and a disappointing experience with a competing app in the repeat billing space, Recurring Orders & Subscriptions by Bold really came to the rescue. One quick phone call and they had us up and running in about an hour. Their level of customer service and technical support blows the other apps out of the water.	1003
101	3	2017-03-28T00:00:00Z	"I will update this review once things have settled: it will either stay at 3 stars or go up to 5.
So far, the app works as intended but its features are not very well adapted to our particular needs - we deliver organic veggies to customers' door. We struggle with the fact that the app sets weekly/bi-weekly deliveries based on the date the customer bought the subscription, rather than the date the customer wants his veggies delivered. There is a bug that prevents customers from adding products to their subscription. We had to pick the Recurring Cart option, which doesn't have the Swap feature. Having one of the veggies out of stock stops the order from being generated, whereas we would just swap the missing veggie for a similar one at the warehouse. Plus a few little annoying things.
BUT - so far, Bold's support has been excellent. Its technical team is working on the bug, Victoria and others are extremely responsive. I will have to pay for customization work, but I do understand this app is designed to serve most of the needs of most users. I am hopeful that once my issues are resolved, I will be able to leave a 5-star review."	1004
101	5	2017-03-27T00:00:00Z	This app is great! The team at Bold is really doing it right!	1005
101	5	2017-03-27T00:00:00Z	The Bold team has moved quickly and is easy to communicate. The current subscription system should work to get my idea off the ground.	1006
101	5	2017-03-24T00:00:00Z	Great app we use on our website www.vetalogica.com.au	1007
101	5	2017-03-24T00:00:00Z	Super nice and easy app! I get an appointment super fast after contacting the support to get some extra feature for my website. They were incredibly fast to help me, they also take time to explain me with screenshot and video so I'll be able in the futur to do it by my self. I'm really really super happy with this app! GO FOR IT!	1008
101	2	2017-03-24T00:00:00Z	"had to request install 3x 
Confusing interface full of ads trying to upsell other products

Subscriptions don't support product variants - so you have to create SUPER clunky options for every variant.

I have a service business, and it's already tough to work around Shopify's myopic focus on Ecommerce.

They offer a lot of customer support but ultimately I'd rather just use something else that's less aggressive"	1009
101	5	2017-03-24T00:00:00Z	Best app ever for a Marketplace	1010
102	5	2017-03-23T00:00:00Z	So easy to use and set up, really impressed and they installed the code :)	1011
102	5	2017-03-22T00:00:00Z	Anytime I have had an issue, support at Bold has gone above and beyond (and quickly) to provide solutions and break things down (Raj is the man!). Even little issues can feel daunting when you don't have time to add another thing to your list—and Bold seriously eases my concerns, quickly, every time. 6 stars.	1012
102	5	2017-03-22T00:00:00Z	"Newbie Bliss !!

Let's face it, we've all had to start at the beginning in everything we do. Going into business for yourself is no different.

That first day, when you sit at your desk, tuck in your chair, flex your wrists and then stare at your screen waiting for some insight into what you are going to do next.

It's a frightening prospect. When you run your own business you are putting yourself our there to be judged. Will people like my products and services? Will people like me? How to I structure my catalog? How do I deal with buyers from different states and countries? How do I retain my customers?

All the thousands of questions you have to answer it is this last one that is perhaps the most crucial one.

We need to WOW our customers. We need to create an unbeatable customer experience and a large part of this can be achieved through the purchasing experience you have.

Imagine running a business, where you rely on customers buying from you month in, month out, or quarter in, quarter out. Then imagine the frustration from those customers if you insisted on sending an invoice for payment for each transaction cycle.

That is one FAST WAY to lose your customers.

The buying experience that is enabled by the BOLD RECURRING ORDERS means that I can offer my customers the SUBSCRIPTION EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME.

It puts all the control into my hands, while creating total ease of purchase and tracking for my customers.

It wouldn't be possible for my business to operate without a recurring order feature. Believe me, I did the research and BOLD offers the best. A powerful, fully supported, totally integrated subscription solution that I couldn't live without."	1013
102	5	2017-03-21T00:00:00Z	"So far so good.
Support is very helpful.
Highly recommend
Only wish we could add a short term free trial period"	1014
102	5	2017-03-20T00:00:00Z	"Using BOLD Apps 'Recurring Orders & Subscriptions' App in conjunction with their 'Memberships' App is an awesome (and automated) way to create a passive income stream by creating 'members only' content & products that can also help build loyalty to your brand. 

Having the Bold Apps Team install the apps, configuring them in the Shopify admin is VERY Quick & VERY Easy. 

At first I was worried about the cost of running both apps ... but then I realized I was only self-sabotaging the growth of my business with those thoughts ... and after crunching numbers and planning things out properly ... I quickly realized how much value I can add to my business ... and my customers.

Now I dont have to worry about the programming side of things, Im looking forward to finishing up my membership site and focusing back on traffic!

Great apps BOLD, have your techs install your apps for FREE was a great move by you guys, well done. - AJ - BIGBoyz"	1015
102	5	2017-03-20T00:00:00Z	This app did everything that I needed it to and more, but what's best is the customer service. They installed it for me and answered all my questions promptly. Highly recommend!	1016
102	5	2017-03-19T00:00:00Z	We've been hoping to grow beyond our Amazon shop, and wanting to take customer service back into our hands where it belongs. Our Shopify storefront customer base has more than doubled since adding Bold to our site and we're thrilled! We now have a steady stream of return customers using your subscription option, and you've allowed us to give them as much control and flexibility as they need while being able to reach out directly to us if needed. We'd give you ten stars if we could!	1017
102	5	2017-03-17T00:00:00Z	"The app is amazing. Helped the business tremendously and even had options that didn't even cross our mind but was so important (one of the many examples - scheduled discounts)

But what really gave the app 5 stars - and honestly deserving of 6 - is the Customer Service. Especially to Morgan who has been so helpful, patient, understanding and im running out of adjectives here but seriously, it feels as if they treat your business as their own. 

I can rave about the Customer Service on and on but try it for youself. Wow."	1018
102	5	2017-03-16T00:00:00Z	Excellent support in getting everything set up and running. Really exceptional customer service.	1019
102	5	2017-03-16T00:00:00Z	The support team at Bold has been great and very helpful with custom solutions when needed	1020
103	5	2017-03-15T00:00:00Z	I found this app when I was looking to move from Recurly and wordpress shop to Shopify platform. Getting the app installed and running to be able to test to make sure it would work for my store was easy. Rob B. with Bold scheduled a Call with me (Yes you get to talk to a person on the phone) and was a big help explaining what the app can do. He also walk me through how to transfer all of my existing customers to this platform. We were up and running in no time with the new store and recurring orders. This is a great app and a great support team to back it up.	1021
103	5	2017-03-15T00:00:00Z	So far so good.  It is a great option for them to install the app free!	1022
103	1	2017-03-28T00:00:00Z	Very misleading. The 1% TRANSACTION FEE was not displayed by the pricing on the shopify app store.	1023
103	5	2017-03-14T00:00:00Z	"Recurring Orders did take some elbow grease to get working but we're so glad that we did! Orders are coming in, and our product is finally getting into the hands of our lovely customers.  Bold Apps was assisting us the entire way through the process, and getting all of the bells & whistles setup for our specific theme above & beyond just making it ""functional"".  

Bold Apps are the best developers on Shopify! There's no competition to the amount of support I received to get everything working."	1024
103	5	2017-03-14T00:00:00Z	"Wonderful app and fantastic customer service. Any issues we run into are resolved almost immediately!

103	5	2017-03-11T00:00:00Z	"Absolutely impeccable customer service. The app is incredibly simple, and when there's ""user error"" involved (ah-em - my error), they are great at finding solutions."	1026
103	5	2017-03-10T00:00:00Z	Responsive. Polite. Patient. Skilled. Prompt. Professional. Helpful...need I say more? This BOLD Team helped with every problem I had so patiently and kindly.Wow, I didn't know that there were people like this still around. Thanks again BOLD.	1027
103	5	2017-03-08T00:00:00Z	"Even though im not sure this feature might not work for my website, i thought for a 90 day free trial i could give it a test.
This app is working great, My recent template was being buggy after they installed but that was due to a conflict with another app, I rolled back my theme to fix the bugs, And the Bold team were nice enough to re-install the Bold Scripts and. Now everything is working smoothly the way it's supposed to thanks to the Bold team. Thank you very Much."	1028
103	5	2017-03-08T00:00:00Z	Super responsive team.  Have found their products to be excellent.	1029
103	5	2017-03-08T00:00:00Z	Robb (my support contact) and Brad (developer) were extremely helpful in resolving a styling issue that was occurring when I toggled between one-time purchase and Subscription. They were very responsive and very helpful. I highly recommend Bold products for their usability, functionality, and exceptional customer service. Thanks again Robb and Brad!!	1030
104	5	2017-03-07T00:00:00Z	New to the service, hoping for a great experience!	1031
104	5	2017-03-04T00:00:00Z	"As an online coffee store I needed to find a way to generate recurring traffic with my customers. It's one thing to buy a bag of coffee but to count on that same customer coming back each time they needed more coffee was a concern to me. I wanted to engage them in a manner that decreased the chance they might find another brand to purchase. Bold allows be to offer the convenience to my customers of not having to go and purchase coffee each time they need it as well as provides me customer loyalty. Bold's Recurring Orders has really been a benefit to not only my store/brand but to my customers.

Bold's support team has always been quick to assist, When I switch to a new theme they are helpful and supportive to get the changes made to the new theme before I go live."	1032
104	5	2020-03-21T00:00:00Z	"BOLD's Recurring Orders app has completely changed commerce for us. While Shopify's platform as been a great experience, we can fully capitalize from online sales because of what BOLD has created with Recurring Orders. Not ONLY is the app awesome, but we have only received first rate support from the entire team when we need help! Their response time to inquiries and the incredibly kind personality of the team is worth far more than what they're charging! We've only had incredible experience with these guys and cannot express our gratitude enough. 

Special thanks to Rob, Alexa, Nicola and Kelsey. Best customer service on the planet. I hope that our own company can treat people as well as BOLD has treated us. THANK YOU to the whole BOLD team for the app and the amazing help you give along the way!"	1033
104	5	2017-03-01T00:00:00Z	"This app is working great, my template was being rude to everything I wanted to do with it, but Brad helped me and fixed everything for me. I gave Brad a bad time because I was not going to be satisfied until everything was just the way I wanted it, but Brad was glad to help. Now everything is working exactly the way it's supposed to thanks to Brad. Brad Brad Brad. Thank you Brad. In case someone is counting, those are 8 ""Brad"", well now that's 9 ""Brad"". Ok, 10."	1034
104	5	2017-03-01T00:00:00Z	"Great app. Works as advertised. Very easy to install. 
Bold people, keep the good work! 
Cheers,"	1035
104	5	2017-02-28T00:00:00Z	Great app! We have been looking for something this detailed for a couple years. We chose Shopify because of this great app and are not disappointed at all! This allows our customers to customize and the details are very nice! Great customer service from their team including James and all the rest! Thank you!	1036
104	5	2017-02-28T00:00:00Z	"Great support to help with little tweaks along the way!  App does it's job, install is not ""simple"", but once you are up and going it seems flawless!"	1037
104	5	2017-02-28T00:00:00Z	This little app is so powerful, when someone inadvertently uninstalled it, the CEO was crushed, just the ability to have customers able to create their own re-occurring monthly orders has worked so well she paid for IT Consulting overtime in order to assess the issue and fix it. She had been so scared that all the previous invoices/customers that had it implemented were all going to have to re-instate this ability. Low and behold, with a little poking around I found what app it was, found residual information on the invoices/customers regarding the App and with only a few emails back and forth it was up and running again very quickly. under a half a day! Being a coder for life and been working on the Internet since the beginning (early 90's) I found it not only very powerful but in terms of being a new coder to this project that was built way before I even started working for the client and that it only took a handful of hours for just me to find out what the App. was, what happened and now fixed, I am amazed! I only exchanged a few emails and got it back up and running, and as for the client, exstatic that all prior information was still within the store that has been running for a few years it would appear. I must say, I am having Support do a run through the site/app as I am new to it but see how important it is to the client I want to make sure I got everything lost back and no conflicting issues come abbout. But, to be truth of my thinking is for the clients ease, as an app this easy to assess and trouble shoot I am confident enough that I can leave it running without a second thought that something else is wrong. And to think, I am on another clients WordPress site that they decided to turn off every Plug-in and the whole site was down so they called me in, and I turned them all on and it was still down, I had to go one by one and I am still finding some issues with the site after a MONTH and over 55 plugins having about half of them not even being used does not help. THANKS FOR A SOLID APP! Kudos! Great job in this app. will be exploring your other apps. for this and future clients with strong recommendations.	1038
104	5	2017-02-27T00:00:00Z	"I switched to Shopify JUST FOR BOLD's apps, specifically the Recurring Orders app. There was nothing else on the other carts that would do what Bold apps would do for me.

The back end of their apps are beautifully organized and informative. They have an incredible support team that will fix any issues in a snap without having to know complicated code. They know what they're doing and they're responsive, and I love that!

I am using the Recurring Orders app to remind me every month to send out my free promotional packs to my PR team as well as a normal box subscription for paying customers. Having the orders auto-generate to Shopify (and then to ShipStation) saves me from headaches and keeps me super organized. It works beautifully and seamlessly. 

There are so many other options and features that I can use in the future that I am excited about! BOLD's apps have so much flexibility and innovative concepts to keep your business growing. I trust BOLD and wish I had a reason to use EVERY one of their apps. They are THAT good. I currently use 4 of their apps and never have an issue with any of them.

The price is worth every penny and come highly recommended by me!"	1039
104	5	2017-02-24T00:00:00Z	Great App & Great Service. Thanks Raj & Team For Making This Easy to Do!	1040
105	5	2017-02-23T00:00:00Z	Very Awesome App for anyone wanting Recurring orders on their Shopify Store Highly recommend to anyone. Staff had install Code for Me every fast and now they have me up and running Thank you Very much everyone over at Bold!	1041
105	5	2017-02-23T00:00:00Z	"I started the equiMedpak online shop a last year selling my own designed equine first aid kit. I currently run the whole shop on my own while I try to build my customer base and hopefully products that I sell. With any online shop it is important to keep evolving to keep customers wanting to come back and buy from you. So with a limited budget I needed to be able to offer my customers and future customers an incentive to want to come and shop at my online shop and this is when I came across BOLD app for subscriptions.

Having set the app up on my online shop I can now offer my customers a much better deal on the veterinary refills for the backpack saving them money but at the same time keeping my stock rotating regularly. Getting them to subscribe also gives me a good customer base to introduce new products as and when. In today's society a retailer must keep their customers engaged and this is where I believe the app will become an invaluable asset to my business helping me to grow especially being a small business trying to make it in the big world!

Trying to single handily build my business it is not always possible financially to have someone come in and set up the IT side of the business so I have to do this myself. Not easy when your not IT in the know how so the support team where brilliant in helping me understand the app so that I could by myself set it up."	1042
105	5	2017-02-22T00:00:00Z	We switched to Bold Recurring from another recurring app and I am so happy we did. The options available to our customers are great (more than the other apps offer) and the look is very clean and easy to navigate. The customer service has been top notch as well. They are quick to respond and very helpful. We love our Bold apps!	1043
105	5	2017-02-22T00:00:00Z	The Recurring Orders App has helped ReelRaw immensely in handling client orders as our clients receive products on a regular basis every month.  The Bold staff have been most helpful in assisting our staff in setting up the application along with integration with our Shopify store.  We highly recommend this App for those who wish to simplify the ordering and subscription process at their store.	1044
105	5	2017-02-17T00:00:00Z	"Great App.  We increased our recurring order by 20% in 3 weeks.   It's much easier for the customer and saves us time!   Totally Worth the price.

105	5	2017-02-16T00:00:00Z	This app was the answer to a prayer! I had spent close to $9000 (!) trying to create the same thing using a platform I abhorred. The day I discovered Boldapps, I jettisoned that lame, patchworked solution I'd spent so much money on, and embraced Recurring Orders by Boldapps and never looked back. Thank you, Boldapps, for saving me untold stress, aggravation and further expense by creating exactly what we needed, and doing it better, cheaper and easier than anyone else. You are superstars!	1046
105	5	2017-02-16T00:00:00Z	"Its been an amazing experience working with Bold support team. I had a tech rep work with me in getting my subscription up and running for my site and its been a wonderful experience. Great attention, tweaks and anything I wanted the rep assisted with. I really appreciate it and appreciate the support team at Bold. 
Thank you."	1047
105	5	2017-02-14T00:00:00Z	Amazing! Outstanding work from the whole team!! Very responsive and always happy to help! We needed to make multiple changes to match our custom design and the team was able to implement everything we wanted. Our subscription feature looks great and already got a recurring order a few hours after launching the feature on our site!	1048
105	1	2020-05-24T00:00:00Z	I wish I could give this app a better rating but I can't - 0/5 at this point. This app is fine if you have a handful of customers. When you have 100 or more, you're in BIG trouble. There is no way to make a change to the order billing date for more than 1 customer at a time. That's right - you have to click in and out of customer profiles so many times to make a very basic change. This makes for a time consuming activity, where you will spend HOURS and HOURS adjusting one customer's billing settings at a time. I've requested a feature to change the billing/order date for more than one customer many times and I get ignored. I pay about $100 a month ON TOP OF the already flat rate because I have so many subscribers. I spend HOURS and hours adjusting billing dates, based on new subscriber imports, which is just terrible. I have asked very nicely that a basic feature like this be installed. Instead, I have been ignored and told I need to pay additional fees for something like this. Something as basic as a bulk/mass change should be included in a VERY expensive app. DO NOT RECOMMEND.	1049
105	5	2017-02-13T00:00:00Z	Simple steps to get this puppy set up. Planned out for sure.	1050

106	5	2017-02-01T00:00:00Z	I really love how easy it is to handle everything. Support is amazingly great, i really love how they can help when i'm in need. The problem with other apps like this one is the lack of certain features or the ways they do it. I did a loads of split testing and i have to say, my costumer loved the UI and the UX of this app, while the others were ....uhm... well, let's just sayed, they weren't performing that well. All in all, it's a great app, both for a user and the shop owner. Whilst you'd think that because it's so easy to use it has some missing features it really has everything. Rare gem this app, it truly is.	1058

107	5	2017-01-28T00:00:00Z	Thank to Bold for installing this app for me. It's super easy to use and I've already got my first recurring order. I wanted to thank Victoria for all of your help, even for my stupid questions!	1063
107	5	2017-01-23T00:00:00Z	"We were looking for the right recurring order app.  Working 80 hour weeks makes it hard to spend free time reviewing apps.  We liked the way you made it easy for us to set it up. We liked the excellent customer service.  

We already have quite a few recurring orders lined up and it has only been a few days.  So thank you for making an excellent product.

They were easy to communicate with and they fixed everything we needed fixed right away. 

Awesome!"	1064
107	3	2018-02-28T00:00:00Z	We can't use this app until it is integrated with Loyalty Points otherwise regular customers can't redeem their points due to the automated nature of the app.	1065
107	5	2017-01-19T00:00:00Z	Super prompt support. Great app! Thanks guys!	1066
107	5	2017-01-13T00:00:00Z	"Our product is totally adapted to recurring orders. It is a food product, that our clients consume in large volume and in a pretty regular way.

2 month after set up the Recurring Order app from Bold, we already have a significant share of our clients signed up for recurring purchases !

In order to make the Recurring Order app work, we had to adapt it to our Shopify template specificities. 

Morgan spent the time to help us get the app integrating perfectly, included the slightly tricky Ajax part in the cart.

That was perfect for us !"	1067
107	5	2017-01-11T00:00:00Z	It is exactly what we need to give convenience to our customers.  They can just sign up for the weekly subscription and then their plans will just be charged every week.  Thanks Bold!	1068
107	5	2017-01-10T00:00:00Z	Very quick install. Looking forward to setting up recurring software subscriptions with this app.	1069
107	5	2017-01-10T00:00:00Z	The BOLD team went above and beyond to integrate this app into our Shopify theme, and has enabled us to significantly enhance the customer experience and our business by offering pre-paid and pay-as-you-go subscription plans, both on individual products and sets of products. We love the ability to change product prices and seamlessly update our subscription offerings as well as the ability to tailor special discounts for our subscription plans.	1070
108	5	2017-01-09T00:00:00Z	Morgan's customer service was outstanding. It single-handedly won me over from a competitor.	1071
108	5	2017-01-07T00:00:00Z	exactly what i needed! thanks!	1072
108	5	2017-01-06T00:00:00Z	We've just started using Recurring Orders and we've already got a few subscribers on the first day! If we need an App we always check if Bold has one first and if they do, we need look no further :)	1073
108	5	2017-01-04T00:00:00Z	Easy to install and super-quick responses from the support team! So far, very impressed.	1074
108	5	2017-01-02T00:00:00Z	Bold has fantastic support for this solid app. This is the top dawg.	1075
108	5	2016-12-22T00:00:00Z	"The BOLD TEAM especially Victoria are amazing. I am using the Recurring Orders & Subscription App for a subscription box launching in January, transferring over from another platform (which is a bit complicated).  They have been stellar in helping me with the complications and details.

The app itself has great settings and is easy to use. My subscription doors open in January and I feel confident the platform will do everything it needs to do.  I will post an update after I have been using it.

Thanks BOLD!"	1076
108	5	2020-04-22T00:00:00Z	Cody, Priyanka and the team are incredibly helpful and responsive even through holidays. Thank you guys! Keep it up!	1077
108	5	2016-12-20T00:00:00Z	Amazing Support provided by the Bold Team! They help you every step of the way to make sure you are supported and in good hands. My experience with them surprised me by their incredible service!	1078
108	5	2016-12-19T00:00:00Z	I have started to use Bold Recurring Orders app recently, and got very positively surprised by its complexity and functionality. And, their customer support team rocks! Can't wait to start working with the app on a daily basis.	1079
108	5	2016-12-17T00:00:00Z	It helps to create a Very accurate financial forecast, when you know exactly how much income is guaranteed in 3 or 6 moths through this app alone! :)	1080
109	5	2016-12-16T00:00:00Z	I've heard amazing things about this app...read most the reviews and I have friend from CurlMix who raves about this app! When I got the idea to start a subscription service I knew 2 things I needed to make this successful, shopify and BOLD! I am so thankful for this amazing service and I am excited about the future of my subscription box. Thank you!	1081
109	5	2016-12-15T00:00:00Z	Great app and even greater customer service. I would recommend this app over the competition, which I've used.	1082
109	5	2016-12-15T00:00:00Z	Awesome and and quickest technical support!	1083
109	5	2016-12-15T00:00:00Z	Victoria was extremely attentive to my needs....so much that she was actually keeping me on track with my projects and deadlines. How about that for software!	1084
109	5	2016-12-14T00:00:00Z	As coffee roasters, this app has been a big help in strengthening our local customer subscription base here in Colorado Springs, as well as on our website with our national audience we are starting to build!	1085
109	5	2016-12-14T00:00:00Z	Love the app! I'm not tech savvy at all... and it was easy to set up!	1086
109	5	2016-12-12T00:00:00Z	So far, the entire Bold team has been amazingly helpful. We were switching from a competitor's subscriptions app and James went above and beyond to help us make the switch and get set up. Great work, Bold!	1087
109	5	2016-12-12T00:00:00Z	It's a no brainer. If you don't need to translate it, this app will be up and running in almost no time. Great support, too!	1088
109	5	2020-04-08T00:00:00Z	Carter was super helpful and knowledgable when I had to reach out multiple times in one day to get answers to my different questions. Top Notch!	1089
109	5	2016-12-11T00:00:00Z	AMAZING APP! The customer service is great! Bold set up the app and turn around time was super fast! I totally recommend this app! Super easy to use! LOVE LOVE LOVE!	1090
110	5	2016-12-09T00:00:00Z	Your app integrates perfectly with our existing stripe account and has allowed us to bridge the gap between our advertised membership programs and organic ones! Bold customer service is always on point too! Thanks so much!	1091
110	5	2016-12-07T00:00:00Z	"We are a new business just launched in December.  We could not have built our store without the recurring billing app because Shopify does not do recurring billing.  We are loving the Bold app!  It was super easy to install.  When we needed a few customizations, the support team was there to help, even through Black Friday and Cyber Monday!  Each time I contact support they have been super friendly and helpful, both by phone and email.  I am really non technical and to have the support was amazing!

Ruth at Cookie Luv"	1092
110	5	2016-12-07T00:00:00Z	Great service and fast support from Bolt, Thanks Brenden!	1093
110	5	2016-12-06T00:00:00Z	We love the app because it allowed us to leave Cratejoy and easily migrate everything on to Shopify! You guys are the best!	1094
110	5	2016-12-03T00:00:00Z	We tried two other recurring subscription apps before moving to Bold Recurring Orders. This is the best option we have found for our website www.getyourboomback.com - customers can log in and manage their own subscriptions which makes it really easy for them and for our support team. We introduced our Subscribe & Save option in response to popular demand and it's now a vital aspect of our business, giving repeat orders every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or even 6 months. Many of our orders are for 6 bottles so that our customers save on discounts and shipping. Our AminoBoosters and AminoPure+ contain clinical dose quantities of YTE®, the only complete natural blend of 22 amino acids. Our customers are discerning and only expect the best of us, knowing that our revolutionary formulas only use genuine ingredients at the right dose. Bold apps help us deliver the high standard of service expected when you need to Get Your Boom! Back.	1095
110	5	2016-12-02T00:00:00Z	I haven't used it yet but it looks incredibly robust and versatile....Squarespace can learn something from these guys!	1096
110	5	2016-11-30T00:00:00Z	"Running a farm, I am always looking for ways to bring my products to my customers in new and creative ways. Using this product, I am now able to offer ""Community Supported Agriculture"" to my online customers."	1097
110	5	2016-11-30T00:00:00Z	It was really extremely easy to have my products setup for subscription. I did it effortlessly within 5 mins after the support team install it. I also want to mention that their support team install it for me over thanks giving. Awesome team!	1098
110	5	2016-11-28T00:00:00Z	Exceptional, responsive, and proactive customer service from these guys. I really appreciate the over-the-phone help from Victoria in setting everything up and also the tweaks they did in my theme to get it looking perfect. This app is great for helping me anticipate how much stock I need to order in and I've already got my first recurring order through! Thanks guys for your useful app and top notch customer service.	1099
110	5	2016-11-26T00:00:00Z	"hey guys, have loved this app since we installed it. Love how easy it is to make changes to things and learn more about it and its flexibility as time goes by! 

Three weeks ago, our retail store was burned down. up until then our retail store was about 70% of our revenue stream and our online about 30%. 

Without the systems we have already set up with this app, we literally would be bankrupt and out on the street as we have not been able to and will not be able to rebuild our shop in its current location. 

We are now going to solely focus on our online store and without this app could not accurately predict our anticipated revenue. It literally has been a life changer for us. 

I've been just working out how to make this app work with the Product options App and the Upsell App. The options are so extensive it is just great!!

Really, the suite of apps you guys and girls build are just next level! I really hope all your team knows how much impact the work they do has on people. 

It's so wonderfully positive. Thanks and sorry I haven't rated it before now. Thank you thank you thank you."	1100
111	5	2016-11-24T00:00:00Z	"Great app - does what it's meant to without a glitch. Awesome customer service - Corey was fast, friendly and resolved my issue promptly. 

www.curebear.com"	1101
111	5	2016-11-22T00:00:00Z	Not only is the app perfect for what we needed (monthly subscription to our apparel), but the customer service was above and beyond. In my line of business, I reallllllly like companies with live chat. Chris was able to fix multiple issues with me immediately and log in and double check things to ensure they were working properly. He went above and beyond and is by far the best live chat person I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He is a HUGE asset to Bold Apps. It totally changed my view of bold apps entirely. I will be looking at more you company offers because this is a GREAT reflection on your company. Keep Chris FOREVER. I only hope the the is who I get help from next time.	1102
111	5	2016-11-21T00:00:00Z	We love the flexibility of the Recurring orders/subscription app. It's amazing all of the different settings you can control. It's a wonderful addition to offer to our customers, sit back and relax and have our wine club automatically delivered to your door! You guys are always great with any questions, no matter how big or small! Perfect for a newbie like me!	1103
111	5	2016-11-20T00:00:00Z	As a coffee wholesaler/retailer it's been tricky for us to get the online retail side of things kick started. Having a really great app in place to route people who come to us asking for repeating small orders has been super invaluable. Our company has been in flux, re-branding and restructuring and now that we're coming out the other side with some additional staffing in place, I feel excited to hand my online strategist a Shopify site with a lot of really great features including the abilty to sell recurring orders thanks to Bold.	1104
111	5	2016-12-06T00:00:00Z	"I already have customers on it !! 
I haven't even emailed my customers about it yet ! 
Love it so far !

UPDATE *
Bold is absolutely fab, please get it if you have a product that is suitable to subscription !! You won't be sorry and it will pay for itself before BOLD even starts billing you for it. It will help me manage my inventory and plan the inventory management easily.

Do it !!"	1105
111	5	2016-11-18T00:00:00Z	So far it's been amazing! Very easy to set-up! :)	1106
111	5	2016-11-14T00:00:00Z	Bold Apps is instrumental in the continued growth of our business. Men use grooming products on a daily basis and having a way to automatically refill orders makes life all that much easier for our customers, and gives us predictable revenue. The few times we needed support the support staff was very responsive and quickly resolved the issue. Many thanks!	1107
111	5	2016-11-12T00:00:00Z	Great help. Smooth install and transition!	1108
111	5	2016-11-10T00:00:00Z	Always a pleasure using Bold Apps Recurring Orders/Subscriptions for our company!  Bold Apps Support by far the best customer service I have experienced!  Quick, simple, and straightforward answers to help with any question or problem I have encountered.  Especially to Victoria and James: Thank you so much!  Very professional.	1109
111	1	2019-02-02T00:00:00Z	I have been using this app for two years, It was not properly installed but since my subscription list has been built on it, I cannot switch over without losing my list.  It has been my greatest issue in terms of my business. I am a subscription box but they have me under the reoccurring product APP. I need assistance with my new upgrade. I have spoken to their support team but they have not been able to assist me. Why am I paying for an app that doesn't do what I need it to do?  I am sincerely stuck when it comes to BOLD, because it does not do what I need it to, and I get laughed at when I call for support. All I need is an app that gives me a section to offer my clients to sign up for the subscription box and bill them. They need to be able to choose 3 boxes, 6 boxes, or 1 year. Not subscribe and save on the same product.	1110
112	5	2016-11-07T00:00:00Z	Excellent app with great customer service.	1111
112	2	2016-11-06T00:00:00Z	"Lots of issues, some of which were ""fixed"" but I learned that superficial changes were made that did not solve the issue. Had issues with processing payments, there was an error one month because the ""system was down"". Some customers had to sign up 2-3 times, never successfully doing it. Automatically takes the person through PayPal if they have anything other than the membership also in the cart, meaning the person does not sign up correctly and is not registered as a subscriber. The offer of compensation was 3 free months, which I appreciated, but it was such a continuing headache I moved to a different app and have had zero issues."	1112
112	5	2016-11-02T00:00:00Z	Love this app!!!! Just when you join make sure you make it clear for your customers how to cancel there membership, make it easy for them to cancel to avoid them getting upset with you. With that said the app is great!!	1113
112	5	2016-10-31T00:00:00Z	Why do I love Recurring Orders? The personalized attention. I just got off the phone with Victoria, who helped me set up the app and gave me multiple tips and pointers to make sure I get the highest conversions for subscription orders. So great!	1114
112	5	2016-10-31T00:00:00Z	Excellent app.  Easy to use.	1115
112	5	2016-10-27T00:00:00Z	Great app! Helped me promote to my customers to do recurring orders.	1116
112	5	2016-10-27T00:00:00Z	From our experience all the Bold apps are great & work! Support is Awesome! #Schwag420	1117
112	5	2016-10-27T00:00:00Z	Great for my recurring subscription needs. I used a different app previously, and the BOLD app is light years ahead. Happy customer!	1118
112	1	2016-10-29T00:00:00Z	Had previously thought that this would be a fantastic app - how wrong I was! Have had nothing but install issues, server crashes and outages where they cannot explain why the app is not working. Was told this morning it could take a couple of days to fix the app on my site through something that has happened on their side, NOTHING I have done. I launch a subscription box business in a few days so naturally, waiting for them to figure out what could be wrong and MAYBE fix it is not an option. Sorry guys, can't wait around on an unreliable app, going elsewhere.	1119
112	5	2016-10-26T00:00:00Z	Brenden and Victoria had impressive response time.  My install was expedited and their customer service was Super!	1120
113	5	2016-10-25T00:00:00Z	Awesome app and awesome support. Perfect, amazing. Tech help that's all too rare nowadays. I tried three other apps and there's no doubt Bold is by far the best.	1121
113	4	2016-10-25T00:00:00Z	"My company uses Bold Subscription at www.noje.biz - check it out if you'd like to see the functionality in action.  I'd definitely recommend this app to anyone looking to offer a subscription service on their e-commerce site.  Their customer support team has been super responsive and helped resolve a couple small bugs within a day or 2.  This app definitely has more features and flexibility than the other subscription apps out there, so I'm definitely pleased.

This app also makes it super easy to offer customers discounts & other incentives to help boost your subscribers.  I really love the insights it gives into your subscriber base as well, and there are so many options for customer emails you can send out it's almost overwhelming (in a good way)!

There are a few missing features and/or quirks with the app that I would love to see changed in a future update (fingers crossed):

1: If my customer opts to pre-pay for a subscription the app takes them straight to checkout instead of adding the item to the cart and having them keep shopping.  This works for some of the items in my store, and may help some store owners with conversion rates, but most of my items are pretty low margin and I would prefer my customers subscribe to more than 1 thing.  This has lead me to remove the prepaid option from my site.

2: I would REALLY love to be able to set a minimum dollar amount for subscription items in my customer's cart.  With my business, if my customer subscribes to, say, a single chocolate bar, I would likely lose money due to packaging costs.  If I could set a condition that the customer must have at least $25 of product in their cart to subscribe, I'd be very happy.

3: The app has you choose between offering a subscription either on the individual items in your store, or on the full cart at checkout.  When I did the install I thought I would be able to offer both, but unfortunately that isn't the case.  This is kind of limiting in my UI and reduces my customers' ability to sign up for subscriptions.  I'd like to be able to offer subscription both on the product page, AND the cart checkout page to encourage people to subscribe.

Like I said before, this is the best subscription app out there and customer service has been so incredible.  Thanks, Bold!"	1122
113	5	2016-10-25T00:00:00Z	I love this app. Easy to use and set up. Tracks all my recurring payments, handles my billing, gives me accurate and up to date reports. This app helps me to focus more on my business instead of chasing customers for payments.	1123
113	5	2016-10-24T00:00:00Z	Just getting started with Bold and subscription service for our dog customers. The support has been great so far and we've already sold our first couple of subscriptions!	1124
113	5	2016-10-23T00:00:00Z	So far, so good.  I like being able to set the subscriptions and forgetting it! Nice job Bold.  Check our www.operatecrate.com to see it in action.	1125
113	5	2016-10-23T00:00:00Z	This app is amazing! It has increased our revenue and customers absolutely love it!	1126
113	5	2016-10-21T00:00:00Z	The support team were very helpful in making some tweaks to the installation, very impressed!	1127
113	5	2017-03-23T00:00:00Z	Recurring Orders & Subscriptions app has been a staple in our store. From the moment I installed this app, I knew that I made the right decision with Bold Apps. They got the app installed and working perfectly on my site and customer service has been awesome. The dashboard is easy to use. My customers love the ease of account setup and management. Recurring Orders & Subscriptions has been the top app in my store. Thank you Bold Apps!	1128
113	5	2016-10-20T00:00:00Z	"This app is a great tool to lock in customers for a predictable buying cycle.  Really great option if you have a products that lends itself to a buying pattern.

I had some issues installing the code manually as I do not have a lot of experience with HTML or CSS but their team stepped in and helped me out at the end."	1129
113	5	2016-10-20T00:00:00Z	Our customers really appreciate being able to subscribe and get our products regularly, and we really appreciate the steady stream of revenue!	1130
114	5	2016-10-19T00:00:00Z	I like how this app allows seamless integration from stripe to shopify. There are lots of options for how to set up your subscriptions. Customer service has been helpful as well.	1131
114	5	2016-10-18T00:00:00Z	Big thank you to Robert the Bold Support Wizard who had us set up in no time. Seamless integration to our shopify store.	1132
114	5	2016-10-17T00:00:00Z	"Works great ! Thank you for the free install
topdognutrition.co.nz"	1133
114	5	2016-10-17T00:00:00Z	This app adds an entirely new dimension to my store, which makes both me and my customers happy...On top of it all, this app is extremely easy to use!  Definitely recommend this app!!!	1134
114	3	2016-12-08T00:00:00Z	"Converted from ReCharge to take advantage of a couple features and due to a technical issue that ReCharge hadn't fixed (was not syncing with my shipping zone with Shopify). I really liked the swap product feature at first, but turns out it wouldn't be supported anymore, and it was a little buggy to use. The ""add to existing subscription""/delete product feature was a decent replacement, but was not an intuitive, straightforward process to customers and required too many steps. There was also an issue of customers being charged for different products and quantities than what was exactly shown on their product list. Support from Bold Apps has always been awesome, and I wish the software worked smoothly for us."	1135
114	5	2016-10-16T00:00:00Z	The setup was very quick and easy. I really appreciated the tutorial video to walk me through it.	1136
114	5	2016-10-15T00:00:00Z	I am just starting to use this app, but have so far been impressed by the prompt support and flexible functionality. Thanks!	1137
114	5	2016-10-14T00:00:00Z	We've had a great experience with Bold Recurring Orders app. It's nice to be able to offer this feature so our customers can have their dog food regularly shipped to their home. Bold is always great with customer support, too, and always addresses and questions or concerns we have with the app. Thanks!	1138
114	5	2016-10-14T00:00:00Z	Brenden has been super responsive and helpful in getting my app set up and integrated with my store.	1139
114	5	2016-10-13T00:00:00Z	Chris updated some CSS super quick...it's like having a developer at your finger tips.	1140
115	1	2016-10-13T00:00:00Z	"Here is why this app is worth a 1 star rating.

I installed the app 3 weeks ago after reading endless 5 star reviews.  As a fellow Canadian company I was excited to support an app built in Canada.  This is what I experienced.

After first installing the app I had a problem with the orders not going to the recurring order checkout.  I contacted support and was told that someone would take a look at it.  I received an email back informing me that everything was fixed.  It wasn't.  I contact support again and let them know I was still having a problem with the orders not showing up properly in the shopping cart.  I was told that they would fix the issue and make my store a seamless experience.  That didn't happen.  While they did fix the issue of the CURRENT products going to the correct shopping cart, any new product I created would still go to the Shopify cart.  I decided to call the support and was told that someone would contact me later that night or the next morning.  That has not happened (it is now day 3).  I have had to delay my store opening by 2 weeks already and am now facing a third week.  

Throughout this time I have been sent emails pandering for me to leave a positive review, starting when I first downloaded the app and hadn't even used it.  The fact that you beg for positive reviews should have been a red flag and explains why you currently have a 5 start rating in Shopify apps.  

I will happily be uninstalling the app this week and look forward to working with recharge for my recurring subscription needs.  This entire experience has been awful."	1141
115	5	2016-10-12T00:00:00Z	Fantastic app and 5-star customer service! My store hasn't launched yet so I have yet to figure out everything that's possible with the app but so far so good. The Bold Support team are superstars, they installed the app for me and helped me when I got stuck with other set-up items. Highly recommend!	1142
115	5	2016-10-11T00:00:00Z	Thanks for this great apps, make my life easy, keep the good job, congrats	1143
115	5	2016-10-07T00:00:00Z	I tried a different app by another company but didn't like it as much as Bold's. Thanks.	1144

115	5	2016-10-02T00:00:00Z	"We launched our business in April this year and a big part of what we do is subscriptions. We offer people the opportunity to have amazing cheese delivered to their door each month. As a start up, we didn't have the budget to pay a developer to set up a system for us. We can only do so much ourselves with the limited IT knowledge that we have, so when we opened our Shopify store it was such a relief to find an app that we could use to handle our re-occuring billing without us having to climb mountains to achieve it. We have found the set up and ongoing use easy and it gives us more time to concentrate on the other aspects of the business.

115	5	2016-10-01T00:00:00Z	"I have to say that this is an incredible App. We did have a slight problem after installation was complete on a Friday late afternoon and we had an expected Launch date that Monday. After sending in a request, outside of their normal support hours the amazing development team worked Friday night into Sunday to correct the issue which was a conflict with another App we were using. Unbelievable support and such a great app. Thanks for your support and outstanding customer service.

115	5	2016-09-30T00:00:00Z	Fantastic app and 1ST class customer support. Cannot speak highly enough of this company!	1150
116	5	2016-09-30T00:00:00Z	Thanks Henry for the fast install of our app.  Highly recommend anyone just hitting install it for me.	1151
116	5	2016-09-28T00:00:00Z	After extensive research we determined that the Bold App (subscription / recurring) was the best bang for buck on a new product and store. We are working hard to grow our subscription base and Bold makes it very easy to integrate promotions and special offers. Bold also makes customization really simple and at the beginning your support staff were very helpful in getting it all working!	1152
116	5	2016-09-28T00:00:00Z	"How often do any of us get to be a real hero. Today my hero is Brenden from Bold Apps. Brenden did in one day what was supposed to take three, and also took the time to make sure the design, colors and fonts matched my web design.  I want to live in a world where people go the distance. Thanks Brenden, today you are truly my hero. Now I can get back to business.

116	5	2016-09-27T00:00:00Z	Appreciate the updates and would love to see the gift subscription option, as well as integrations for buy buttons. Thanks!	1154
116	5	2016-09-26T00:00:00Z	Great app. Easy for my customers to use for subscribing to our auto-refill program, and easy for my fulfillment team to use for processing orders. Highly recommend this app for recurring order options on your store. Also, the support staff is very good.	1155
116	5	2016-09-26T00:00:00Z	I'm giving this 5 stars because even though we have had to tweak some things, Bold has been completely responsive usually within less than 24 hours. We just launched our e-commerce section of our site so we look forward to seeing how this subscription option continues to work for us.	1156
116	5	2016-09-24T00:00:00Z	So far so fabulous! And a huge shout out to Brenden who made sure we have easy access to all the tools you offer! You rock Brenden! - Kasey :)	1157
116	5	2016-09-23T00:00:00Z	The support department at Bold is great! Brenden quickly set-up the liquid programming and customized it to fit our theme. It looks great! Once that was complete, the app was easy to configure. Thanks for making it easy enough for a coffee roaster to use!!	1158
116	5	2016-09-23T00:00:00Z	After attempting installation ourselves (because what amateur doesn't like to play around with important code) our site was misbehaving like a 3 year old toddler who didn't get his way. So we opted for the free installation route by Bold. After approving them just last night, we awoke to an email from Brenden with the successful installation of the code. Big kudos to Brenden for his liquid wizardry!	1159
116	5	2016-09-23T00:00:00Z	So far so good with the app. Brendan the biggest, baddest, boldest liquifier in the house installed the app to my site in record time. Shout out to my main man Brendan. SUUUP BRENDAN! Stay bold........	1160
117	5	2016-09-23T00:00:00Z	Love this app! Makes setting up subscriptions a breeze.	1161
117	3	2016-09-22T00:00:00Z	"We are selling custom software on subscription and want to integrate our billing with Shopify since it's such a sophisticated shopping cart.  We need to do recurring billing to make that possible.  We tried this out and found it wasn't a perfect fit for our needs.  The software we want to sell through Shopify can't interact with this plugin because it doesn't have it's own API that we can talk with.

This would be a great plugin for the right kind of customer but wasn't for our needs."	1162
117	5	2016-09-22T00:00:00Z	"So far so good. Easy. Intuitive. Excited to start seeing customers use it.

Support is great. Thanks again, Brenden!"	1163
117	5	2016-09-22T00:00:00Z	Bold's customer service is amazing. We literally feel like we have another team member here at the company. They always reply with in a day and always make us feel like are questions are welcomed and they always thoroughly answer every questions. Their recurring orders app has helped our company increase sales by 30%. We couldn't be happier!	1164
117	5	2016-09-21T00:00:00Z	The app works like a gem! Customer service is fast and very helpful too!	1165
117	4	2016-09-21T00:00:00Z	A little confusing at first, it just takes some committed time and you can figure it out. Once you get it figured out, the cost is certainly worth the benefits. It seems like there's a conflict of interest if they're asking us to write a positive review for the chance to get a reward...	1166
117	5	2016-09-21T00:00:00Z	Support team are incredibly flexible and attentive, they sorted this out for me with no hassle and are there to help at any time.	1167
117	5	2016-09-20T00:00:00Z	There are two main things I love about this app: One, it makes my entire business model possible and easy within Shopify; Two, the team behind it are awesome - super responsive, really helpful, just roll up their sleeves and help you out whenever you have a problem. The fact that a coding technotard like myself can run an ecommerce subscription box business speaks volumes about how easy the app is to use and how great the support is. The billing features, flexibility and near-seamless integration into Shopify literally make our business possible, allowing us the full customisation of normal Shopify, with all the power of a true subscription commerce platform - literally unmatched by other solutions available (and trust me, I looked!).	1168
117	1	2016-09-19T00:00:00Z	Sorry but customer support has not gotten back to me.	1169
117	5	2016-09-19T00:00:00Z	Well done.  Great on customer service and communicating. Delivered what I think will be a great addition to our store.  Thank you!	1170
118	5	2016-09-18T00:00:00Z	Fast service. Very intuitive software.	1171
118	5	2016-09-16T00:00:00Z	I been looking for a app like this for my store for some time! Glad someone made it!	1172
118	5	2016-09-16T00:00:00Z	Great Service Each Time I speak with Victoria at Bold.....Highly recommend!	1173
118	5	2016-09-15T00:00:00Z	"I did a lot of research and testing before I decided to go with this app. All of the team at Bold is great however there was one person who freaking knocked it out of the park.

THANK YOU BRENDEN for installing the app and making it look more like my theme. Design is very important so I appreciate you taking the time to do that without even being asked.

If anyone at BOLD should get a raise it would be BRENDEN

If you're thinking of using this app you should ask for Brenden and you'll get amazing service."	1174
118	5	2016-09-14T00:00:00Z	Definitely a must for any biz!!	1175
118	5	2016-09-14T00:00:00Z	So far Recurring Orders has been a huge help for our business. We've been running a subscription based service for 5+ years. Over the last couple years we've grown very quickly and our old spreadsheet method just couldn't keep up with the growth. Recurring Orders helped us import our data and has significantly cut down the time we spend managing orders. One of the best features of Recurring Orders is the fact that it's built on arguably the most robust online commerce sites available, Shopify. Great job team. Keep up the good work. -Jim	1176
118	5	2016-09-13T00:00:00Z	Bold is doing what others should be. Brenden was a great help installing the code.	1177
118	5	2016-09-13T00:00:00Z	Excellent addition to the store.  Many of our disabled living clients and/or carers use our recurring orders and be confident their order will be with them on the same day every occurrence.	1178
118	4	2016-09-13T00:00:00Z	"This is exactly what we were looking for.
Very easy integration thanks to the tech team at Bold Apps.

Try it!

118	5	2016-09-13T00:00:00Z	"I am in the process of switching my current customers from the system of Infusionsoft to Bold. It all started when everyone on my customer service team was insanely unhappy using IS, and I was looking for an alternative. Shopify recommended Bold, and I decided to give it a try. 

The first thing I really like about Bold, besides the fair pricing, is that it allows my customers to manage their own accounts/subscriptions. This is huge! It also has not had any hang ups or glitches like our old system - like kicking people off subs or moving them to a new one of its own mind! 

My customer service team is able to create accounts for our customers who aren't as tech-savvy by simply doing so by logging out of the system, and getting their information and entering it over the phone. This way we can go in later and manage it however necessary if they continue to not want to do so themselves or otherwise can't. (I wish we could do this from inside the system, but Bold has told us that they don't allow that for security of personal info purposes.) 

Being able to use a modern system that easily integrates with Shopify is life-changing for me. My customers are happy and my customer service employees are happy and that's huge and more than I could ever ask for. Thanks, Bold! I am looking forward to the many added features and updates Bold adds that will only improve everyone's experience from here!"	1180
119	5	2016-09-12T00:00:00Z	Thanks, Brenden - appreciate all the assistance!	1181
119	5	2016-09-06T00:00:00Z	So far so good! Just installed it last week. But the support is beyond excellent for setting up this app. Shout out to Henry for his help!	1182
119	5	2018-10-17T00:00:00Z	I love that it takes the guess work out of the subscription process for me AND my customers! It's easy to navigate and someone who isn't into coding or internet heavy lifting can still use it. It works great with my e-commerce store AND with useful shipping options--which is a shop owners dream. I've contacted customer support more than once and they've been helpful and attentive. Cody and Kyle are rockstars and help me regularly!! A big thanks to BOLD for great customer service!	1183
119	5	2016-09-05T00:00:00Z	"This app has amazing functionality.  It does require a little more setup, it's not plug and play, but the ease of use and the level functionality as a customer and a store owner is unparalleled.  It is worth the effort if you have a strong and growing business.

We have been using another subscription app that will be unnamed, and all of our grievances with that app are being solved by us switching over, and I literally mean ALL of them.  Customers can ship upcoming orders immediately, easily substitute products, have more control over their delivery schedule, can easily change their shipping option/method, and so much more.  On our end, we can do things like substitute products that are comparable, give discount codes to existing subscribers, send them more comprehensive e-mail notifications with more triggers, and again, so much more, things we never could do before.  The discount code system in this app is based on Shopify's system, and we think it's superior.

One of my favorite features is that this app can force customers to sign up for an account, but only if they are subscribing.  Before, we would have had to force all customers to sign up for accounts, even for 1-time purchases, or none at all.  It forced us to either increase our subscription support tickets or reduce sales.  The problem is that so many subscribers didn't know where to go to adjust their subscription because they never signed up for an account, which caused a lot of problems.

Our old subscription app also had squat for reporting, so now we can really see how our sales and subscribers are growing with projected revenue.  We can also refund people in the app for returns rather than going into the payment gateway (like stripe), and it updates the order in shopify to reflect this, whereas our old app did not, requiring us to manually add notes to the order.  The level of customization with CSS/HTML is also wonderful, so we can make everything look beautiful on our store.  

It's also worth noting that Bold has incredible customer support, so if you run into issues or have questions, they are there for you.  To Victoria and everyone else that helped us, thank you!  If you have great ideas for features, they will listen and continue to improve upon their apps.  Plus, for the price they charge for these highly functional apps is 100% worth investing in.

We compared Bold to our current subscription app over a year ago, and now we sorely regret not switching then.  It seemed on par, but we clearly didn't do our homework.  Though the transition will be difficult in switching apps (and be warned if you're switching, this is not easy), we know it's worth it in the end.  What Bold has done to this app is incredible, and now we are installing several more of their apps to do product bundles, wholesale, and so much more."	1184
119	5	2016-09-03T00:00:00Z	Awesome...Just started with it and easy to navigate.  Support is dialed in to maximize ease of use	1185
119	5	2016-09-03T00:00:00Z	Great App, pays for itself and has delivered a number of new 'effortless' subscriptions for our Matcha Tea in the way that we use it at www.teaologists.co.uk	1186
119	5	2016-09-02T00:00:00Z	Brenden killed it!  Got our liquid installation up and running in  less than 24 hrs.  Super easy experience and great product.  Good job bold.	1187
119	4	2016-09-02T00:00:00Z	"I'm using the app to capture buyers who might otherwise only buy my products once. The secret to any business is sustainable and predictable revenue. This app will allow me to launch a Subscribe and Save Program focused on eliquid for the vapor or ecig crowd. I am confident that we will be able to build a sustainable business through this program. Wish me luck, I'm just designing the program now.

119	5	2016-12-05T00:00:00Z	Bold is amazing. The customer service has helped me figure out all the steps I needed to grow my business. I started off with zero experience, and they were more then happy to answer all my questions. The service they offer is top notch, and I cannot suggest Bold enough.	1190
120	5	2016-08-30T00:00:00Z	The customer service and support provided by the Bold team has been incredible. The app is easy to use and is generating recurring revenue that we didn't have before. If we could give 10 stars, we absolutely would.	1191
120	5	2016-08-30T00:00:00Z	I am not very computer savvy; however, Bold has simplified the recurring order process for me and my leadership/life coaching business. I would highly recommend their app in Shopify! Easy to use and customer care remarkable!	1192
120	5	2016-09-21T00:00:00Z	"I wish I could give more than 5 stars to show how awesome Bold teams are. Their fast response and ability to customize to meet your need make this must-have app. Highly recommend to anyone who need recurring feature.

Can't write enough to indicate how great this app is and Bold teams are. Full customization feature and excellent service make this app outstanding highly recommended. Awesome!!!"	1193
120	5	2016-08-29T00:00:00Z	Brenden did all the coding work behind the scenes super fast.  It's all set-up and working perfectly. I even had a call from them to onboard my first group of  products - super fast and easy to use.	1194
120	5	2016-08-26T00:00:00Z	Very happy so far, asked them to set it up for me and it works perfectly and keeps the theme of the site, thanks Brenden for that.	1195

I went thru the whole checkout process myself and I must say it IS SMOOTH.
Would like to see a little more documentation on the buffering info and some others but other than that I'm very happy!  Thank you BOLD!"	1200
121	5	2016-08-24T00:00:00Z	"We've been trying to increase our own on-line orders vs wholesale orders. Our product, Action Wipes (body wipes for when you can't shower) are the perfect subscription item for our target markets of home care, outdoor adventure, fitness, music festivals and more. Many of our current users are repeat buyers, so we're hoping that by offering them an easy, no-brainer process to reorder, that can be easily cancelled, it will make their shopping experience on our site simple. It worked! We've had the app 3 weeks and we already have several subscribers.

The app is easy to use and the support is great. We had one small issue with variants when we first installed it, but I notified the support team, explained what was happening and they took care of the bug quickly. Now it works perfect."	1201

121	5	2016-08-20T00:00:00Z	This has been a great app for us to generate recurring revenue. It is very simple for our customers to subscribe & save. Also, support has been very helpful, I plan to continue to use this app as our recurring orders continue to grow.	1205

121	5	2016-08-16T00:00:00Z	Simple to install, does what it promises. Takes some time to understand how the whole recurring ecosystem works, but once you've gotten the hang of it this app will take care of all your subscription needs.	1210
122	5	2016-08-16T00:00:00Z	Great app. We sell pet grooming products like dog shampoo so a recurring order is something useful to our customers and this functions similar to Amazon's subscribe and save. No reason not to copy the best in the biz.	1211

123	5	2016-08-09T00:00:00Z	"I had specific needs for a recurring billing model and had explored many eCommerce sites.  I selected Shopify as my store provider based largely on the availability of the Recurring Orders App from Bold.  The App simply did everything I could think a recurring billing model should do. My customers can mix subscription based orders with regular one-time orders.  There is plenty of email templates that you can utilized to personalize the process.  The best features are the customer self management features.  Customers can add additional product to their subscriptions, cancel their subscriptions, skip a month, change their addresses, credit cards etc. all on their own.  This is only half of the available features.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed.

We, at moJJa, finally launched our underwear subscription - I mean who couldn't use fresh underwear each month?! And it's delivered to your mailbox :)

Working with the Bold Team was an absolute pleasure.  I recall calling one Friday afternoon to inquire about the subscription app and the functionality.  Within the following 4 weeks, moJJa was up and running.  It was fairly straightforward from downloading the app, to adding the products and creating the subscription offering.  

I had contacted the Bold Team a few times along the way and each interaction, be it over the phone or via email, was extremely successful where the staff was helpful and explained things well.

Now it's all about growing our base!  If you, or anyone you know who, would enjoy receiving fresh, comfortable underwear to their mailbox, head on over to www.mojja.ca to get started!

Cheers,

They have been thrilled by my new Collectors Series offering! I am able to offer a them unique collectable pieces made by me and shipped to them quarterly. It is a great mix of retail with the reliable  sales of wholesale. This has been a huge shift in by business and has definitely brought in more consistent cash flow. Thanks!!!

My whole entire experience with Victoria Stephens has been fantastic!! I downloaded the app and she immediately emailed me asking how she could help to the multiple phone calls we've had where she has helped me shape this product to be perfect for my business/me and my customers. She has been great, kind, smart, and fun to work with! She has given me great insight with how best to work with the app within the ideas I had for my new product offering. I couldn't have done it without her. Thank you so very much Victoria!!
Also, Morgan did great with altering how my widget looks on the product page!! Intuitive design and quick support!"	1226
123	3	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	So far it seems to be working properly. I am waiting on a couple of issues to get fixed by support so that the subscription widget displays more neatly on my site. Also, for some reason the %off for pre-paying in advance does not display correctly to the customer when they select longer frequencies to obtain a lower discount. One of the other downsides is that customers have to leave their account on your website to go to an external site to manage their orders. Lastly, and the biggest reason I am giving a 3 star, is that it would be nice to have a simple function to charge the customer full price for the 1st subscription, and then give a nice discount for their 2nd and ongoing orders. This would help ween out a lot of those folks that just signup for the initial discount and then cancel a week later claiming they signed up by accident. If support pulls thru on those other two issues and they make the app a bit functional towards a variety of ways to setup, then I may bump my rating up a star or so... Overall though, I do see where this app is something I want to continue using because I have set my current orders up in a way that I think will bring good steady revenue, as I have had some success in the past with similar apps.	1227
123	5	2016-08-05T00:00:00Z	Always good stuff from Bold Apps!	1228
123	5	2016-08-03T00:00:00Z	"Simple and easy to use, you can start selling subscriptions day 1, another great app from BOLD!

123	5	2016-08-03T00:00:00Z	"Just launched the recurring payments online and we are already enjoying the benefits. Great app and great service from the Bold team. 
Hope there is a way to pause and restart subscriptions."	1230
124	5	2016-08-02T00:00:00Z	We tested out one of the other main subscription apps, but Recurring Orders worked better for our needs.  We required a large amount of customization and have been able to do 90% of what we want with Recurring Orders.  And their support team is generally very helpful when we need it.	1231
124	5	2016-08-02T00:00:00Z	Brenden was helpful and they hit you over the head with customer service.	1232
124	5	2016-08-02T00:00:00Z	80% of our customers are recurring and we simply couldn't do it without these guys. Great App!	1233
124	5	2016-08-01T00:00:00Z	"Awesome! Over half our orders are recurring and we have a stable flow of orders because of it. This wasn't the case before we got the app which means people were simply forgetting to re-order and so they probably just picked up their coffee when they were at the store. But now it's simply more convenient then any other way!

Thank you BOLD!"	1234
124	5	2016-07-31T00:00:00Z	"We switched over to Shopify from another provider because of Bold's Recurring Orders & Subscriptions add-on App.  Our clients have already commented on how the new site subscription features make it easier for them.  We look forward to our continuing growth thanks to Bold.  Also a huge shout out to Brenden for his patience and expert guidance along the way!

I highly recommend this App to any provider of subscription boxes or other businesses requiring recurring billing on a great platform like Shopify."	1235
124	4	2016-07-29T00:00:00Z	This is a great app for the cost - the only thing I notice is that people subscribe to receive the discount on their purchase then they cancel... ughhh. What would be great is if the first item could get 0-really small incentive, then the second shipment (once we know they are real subscribers) could get the real discount we want to give to loyal customers. So say 0 or $1 on order 1, $10 on the next 11 shipments...	1236
124	4	2016-07-28T00:00:00Z	Has helped secure thousands of dollars in recurring revenue each month. Definitely an app worth considering for hands-off orders. I would have given 5 out of 5 stars if the interface was more user friendly for customers who want to order in single units or cases, and with or without subscriptions displaying the new unit cost and the savings per unit.	1237
124	5	2016-07-28T00:00:00Z	I'm new to Bold but I'm finding the app very useful and they make it easy for a non technical person like myself to understand it all. I would recommend it to everyone.	1238
124	4	2016-07-27T00:00:00Z	Been using the app a few weeks and technical support is good, and the app is  easy to use.  It would be nice if Bold processed the recurring orders at a set time (eg midnite, since that is how shopify reports are broken down) rather than usually between 6-9am CST	1239
124	4	2016-07-27T00:00:00Z	"Good subscription service for shopify.
However, shopify itself isn't very good for subscription sites...
over all pretty good!"	1240
125	4	2016-07-26T00:00:00Z	This app works great. Easy set-up and easy for customers to sign up and manage their own subscriptions. Super-easy for us to manage their subscription, too! We used to use PayPal for subscriptions and couldn't make simple changes for customers (such as adding another bag of coffee) due to PayPal limitations. This app makes it easy to keep our customers happy!	1241
125	5	2016-07-26T00:00:00Z	"We've been using this for months with great success. Our business is unique and requires unique solutions - we use this app to automate our diaper service orders. We jumped from PayWhirl to this and have been glad ever since. 

WHAT I LOVE: 
- My customers can manage their own service. They login, skip weeks, swap subscriptions, all without calling or emailing me! If they choose to contact me, I can update everything manually. 
- The features keep getting better. There were a few key functions that I asked for in the beginning (like being able to manually add coupons for existing customers) that have been added now. BOLD is really listening and pumps out improvements all the time. 
- Gift/Prepaid subscriptions. Awesome. With this, I can also offer a discount for prepaid subscriptions, which means cash flow! 
- One checkout - customers can subscribe AND make one-time purchases all at the same time. The customer facing side is awesome.
- Custom automate emails that can be branded (withing reason). My customers love the touch points
- Consistent charge times. For me, at 8:07 every am the orders for that day come through. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but I love being able to depend on it. Slurp down the rest of my coffee and get moving!
- I can manually select start dates for subscriptions. 
- BOLD customer service has been stellar. Helped with a liquid issue, very responsive, honest, and want me to succeed. 

What I'm looking forward to seeing: 
- full Shopify gift card integration. Currently I work around this manually by cancelling the gift card and issuing a coupon for the amount, which is a slight PITA. 
- Minimum recurring order option - I'd like to make the customer buy a block of prepaid orders up front and then keep going. This option will be A+ for services like mine or a consultant or business coach."	1242
125	5	2016-07-28T00:00:00Z	Great app and great customer support!	1243
125	5	2016-07-26T00:00:00Z	Recurring Orders is easy to implement and update. It's been a big part of growing a sustainable retail coffee business.	1244
125	5	2016-07-26T00:00:00Z	"This is really one of the BEST apps in the Shopify app store. The functionality is awesome and flawless. Their customer support is incredible. We needed some customization done so that it fit our store's look and feel and they spent so much time making sure it was perfect. 

Unfortunately, Shopify won't store credit cards and this app from Bold allows for recurring billing so we don't lose out on keeping a customer for the long-term. 

Thanks Bold!"	1245
125	5	2016-07-25T00:00:00Z	"Fast respond & installation, 

I´m not a technology fan, but they make it so easy!!!!

You are doing it great! 
Thank you Brenden, Paul & Bold team!"	1246
125	5	2016-07-25T00:00:00Z	This app is so simple to use! My customers absolutely love having this option to subscribe to products. Bold Apps is great!	1247
125	5	2016-07-25T00:00:00Z	I was looking for a complete solution to my subscription based service and I found bold through a recommendation. They are great and solved all my needs and have been very helpful in answering my questions. I highly recommend!	1248
125	5	2016-07-25T00:00:00Z	Really great app and support staff - quick to reply to tickets and go above and beyond to help us get setup!  Highly recommended for automating subscriptions!	1249
125	5	2016-07-22T00:00:00Z	Thank you so Much Brendon!!!  I appreciate you getting my update done quickly	1250
126	5	2016-07-20T00:00:00Z	"Greetings. Basically what we do is sell wine!  In our region, the online wine selling environment is cero, and all online retailers that are available do not ship to our area.  We started researching the industry, researching the users, and we found out an interesting insight.  Regular users would prefer to have in stock their favorite wine always, and not have to go search where it is available in the brick and mortar stores.  So we developed this web site, where users could buy one time ones, but also could put in a recurring order of that special wine they want to have always in their house/office.

Recurring Orders helped us fulfill that specific insight that customers were looking for, and when combining it with the Membership APP it gave us the ability for not only delivering on that insight, but to also have special membership offers to those uses. 

The combination of this two apps is explosive!

Thanks so much for creating them!

I have had various experiences with your support team.  From helping me install the app in my store (which was done more quickly that I though it would be), to helping me understand better how it worked, to being available for any additional question that I had.  Corey, Aubrey and Victoria have been awesome being available for anything.  #ShoutOut!"	1251
126	4	2019-09-16T00:00:00Z	"So far, so good!  I think this is a great app and seems to have very good functionality.  The support is great and they seem to really want you to be a success.  Brenden did a great job installing our liquid and Morgan answered all my questions and fixed a little problem for me.  We have not been running it very long but so far it looks like exactly what we wanted!
I got very good assistance from Rajni and Jordan through a chat online to fix a problem I couldn't figure out.  Thanks guys!"	1252
126	5	2016-07-19T00:00:00Z	This app is going to save so much time and money, Love it.  Thanks Bold	1253
126	5	2016-07-19T00:00:00Z	This app is great! im no coder, but i was able to do the liquid install with the directions provided, bold will do the install for free if you dont have the time. They rock! i would recommend!	1254
126	5	2016-07-19T00:00:00Z	Brad was a real star. He was very professional and spent as much time as was required to get the job done and to my utmost satisfaction. Excellent service at Bold.	1255
126	5	2016-07-19T00:00:00Z	Easy step by step set up after the Wizards do their magic! Wish they would use Pay Pal directly but they do Offer another PayPal / Braintree alternative plus their main cash flow app. So no matter what it is simple and easy to use. Can't wait to see this puppy in action!	1256
126	5	2016-07-18T00:00:00Z	I was told the installation process would take up to 3 business days but Brenden, my Bold Support Wizard had it up and running the next day along with a very thorough email explaining everything I would need to know. A+ customer service from Bold once again!	1257
126	5	2016-07-18T00:00:00Z	Customer service was terrific. Brandon did a wonderful speedy job. I think I am going to love this app. once it is live at Ewegurt.com	1258
126	5	2016-07-18T00:00:00Z	Brandon is great! Setup was very very quick after installing the app. www.jewelsrule.com	1259
126	5	2016-07-17T00:00:00Z	Great recurring order app! We were using another one, but made the switch to Bold. Now we are able to give more options to our customers and more of them are going for subscriptions. Thanks Bold	1260
127	5	2016-07-15T00:00:00Z	Wow, this has been a GREAT online experience with BOLD.  I had my assistant research apps for recurring payments and she hands down recommended Bold.  I was NOT up for a big installation challenge and when we needed help Bold stepped right up and installed the app seamlessly with my shop.  Before I even let my customers know it was set up I got my first recurring order for 198.00 per month! Thank you for helping me make shopping easier for my clients.  They LOVE the convenience of getting their supplements every month hassle free.	1261
127	5	2016-08-11T00:00:00Z	"Great app and customer service!  Very useful app and works exactly as they say it does.  
Responded within an hour by Brenden."	1262
127	5	2016-07-13T00:00:00Z	"Excellent app, far superior than another subscription app we tried before. 
The support is terrific too, very responsive.
I strongly recommend it!"	1263
127	5	2016-07-12T00:00:00Z	"I have been contemplating providing a subscription option for my customers for quite some time, but never pulled the trigger... until now. We just launched the subscription option and to great customer fanfare. Brenden helped me out (quickly) with getting it all set up. I know a bit about liquid, and how to add code, but at this point in my business's operation, I decided to let someone else help me. Brenda was quick to respond and install the liquid code (even matching the look to my own store) within 14 hours of initial download. The one ""con"" I have with the app so far, is I am unable to find out if I can test the app to ensure that it is working properly on my storefront. Other than that, everything went smooth, set up was simple (requires some knowledge of general Shopify operation) and looks great on the site. This app is free for 3 months, and because of that offer, I decided to give it a go and see how my customers like it. I assume we will continue on with the subscription offering even beyond the free 3 months, but only time will tell. Again, Brenden was prompt and I was excited to get the email stating everything was set up and ready for customization and launch. Thanks again! I'll write another one in a month."	1264
127	5	2016-07-12T00:00:00Z	"We were using a hand-coded system which did not integrate with shipping.  You can imagine the hassle!  Everything had to be requested via email, from skipping shipments to changing shipping addresses.  If that wasn’t enough to make us fling ourselves down a steep flight of stairs, we had to manually charge each customer every month. 

Now that we have moved to Shopify and Bold's Recurring Orders & Subscriptions, it’s a different story.  We are integrated with shipping, subscription charges happen automatically, and our customers can do so much for themselves now!  We’ve heard already how empowering it is for them to be able to change their own billing/shipping addresses, frequency of shipping, swap out cat product preference, or cancel a shipment.  So, overall, we look like heroes.  Our customers love us, and it’s all because of you guys.  Every single day feels like we are a Disney Princess.  We sing, and birds fly in and make our beds while squirrels do the dishes.  THAT’S how you make us feel.  Magical.

Additionally, we no longer try to fling ourselves down steps…for the most part."	1265
127	5	2016-07-11T00:00:00Z	Bold has gone above and beyond in customer service and technical support. Every question and/or issue we've had has been resolved very quickly! We are currently using 2 Bold Apps and would gladly use more if the need arose.	1266
127	5	2016-07-11T00:00:00Z	Great app easy to set up and also bold has a great team given the customer the best support you could have. High recommend.	1267
127	5	2016-07-10T00:00:00Z	Brenden was very helpful and quick to install my app for me!	1268
127	5	2016-07-07T00:00:00Z	Really great app - would 100% choose it over the other subscription apps	1269
127	5	2016-07-07T00:00:00Z	This is just the best app ever. You must add this to your store especially if your products are purchased multiple times by the same people.	1270
128	5	2016-07-06T00:00:00Z	cool app cant wait to test it out. from the looks of it i would deff tell my friends about this for all there stores	1271
128	5	2016-07-06T00:00:00Z	Really cool apps from Bold....	1272
128	5	2016-07-17T00:00:00Z	"OMG the support team has been AWESOME to a 'T'!!
They installed the liquid for me (to begin with I had no idea what this was - got a learning curve happening)
I've had a lot of questions back and forth to set it up for my product which is not straightforward to how it would normally be used and the team have answered all my questions, even adding code to my Theme to make it work properly (and the Bold Customer Support is faster at answering my questions than Shopify is!) - I love you guys!"	1273
128	5	2016-07-05T00:00:00Z	Since installing Recurring Order and Subscriptions we've had great service and wonderful people to work with at Bold. They have been quick to answer any questions we had or trouble shoot issues, and the follow-up call after installation was a nice touch. Thank you!	1274
128	5	2016-07-05T00:00:00Z	This is the exact solution we needed for offering recurring orders on our store. The flexibility and functionality are spot on. We continue to be impressed by the Bold team and their suite of applications. Having tried numerous apps from other developers, I can honestly say that none of them have even come close to the level of competency and professionalism we have received from Bold. Kudos! Keep up the good work.	1275
128	5	2016-07-02T00:00:00Z	I just had this app implemented in the last week, so I haven't had much experience with it - but it seems great so far. The customer service team has been awesome. Brendan did the liquid installation super quickly, and Victoria has been really helpful with her customer service as well!	1276
128	4	2016-07-01T00:00:00Z	This app is highly recommended. It's installed in two stores now and working beautifully for us. Bold support has been helpful in further refining our displays and subscription email notifications and they are always responsive.	1277
128	5	2016-07-01T00:00:00Z	Great app for recurring orders! I'm not very good with code or HTML editing so the free help to install the app on my store was a huge bonus and done within 24 hours. This is my second app from Bold and I will definitely be trialling more!	1278
128	5	2016-06-30T00:00:00Z	Great app. Works as described and is reliable and effective. Bold Apps will quickly install the app for you and it is easy to set up subscriptions. 100% Recommended.	1279
128	5	2016-06-29T00:00:00Z	We needed to customize the app quite a bit to work for our unique business model, and the team at Bold (Victoria, Brad, Randy) was super helpful in getting us set up. They are friendly, professional, and fast... I had a couple of calls with their support team and everything was sorted out. I looked at other options, but Recurring Orders was the only solution that was flexible enough for us and truly integrated with Shopify.	1280
129	5	2016-06-28T00:00:00Z	"So I just received my first recurring order just a few days after having installed the app!

Brenden was brilliant and got everything working for me in lightning speed - literally told them there was no rush when I took their FREE install option and boom... done. I didn't even have time to drink my coffee in between.

The interface is great, so simple and easy to use and understand with great help popups if you get a bit confused.

Wish I had found you guys earlier... Already looking at your Order Management App and Loyalty one!"	1281
129	5	2016-06-28T00:00:00Z	An excellent app, from the integration done so by their team, to the different billing options and recurring cart options. Ideal for any subscription business	1282
129	5	2016-06-29T00:00:00Z	"Love, LOVE, L.O.V.E. the Recurring Orders APP... If you don't have it, you NEED it. Or maybe you like LOSING MONEY every day!  (BTW, Victoria, Brad and Corey rock support and tech help!!)

- Ricky and Larry (The Coffee Cousins)"	1283
129	5	2016-06-23T00:00:00Z	"Thank you Brenden for your awesome job. It was easy to follow. I like this simple apps. I hope it works well. We're happy to find this app.

Thanks again Brenden for the simple instruction"	1284
129	5	2016-06-23T00:00:00Z	Awesome like all other Bold apps!	1285
129	4	2016-06-21T00:00:00Z	Bold made it easy to install and configure this app to automatically start taking recurring orders. Overall pretty solid and no complaints so far.	1286
129	5	2016-06-21T00:00:00Z	This app is amazing.......simply said. www.japancandymonthly.com would not be live without the aewsome support from the staff at BOLD. They even installed the liquid for free! Most apps would only give the option to do it yourself! I definitely recommend Recurring orders and Subscriptions. This app is amazing!	1287
129	5	2016-11-23T00:00:00Z	"Great app... simple and functional... Support is responsive and I would loved to recommend to others... 

There are tons of options and configuring the same is easy and simple. Good job guys.

Check my website for its example www.iptvonline.ca (check monthly subscriptions)

One of the best app from one of the best developers. Through this app I have increased my revenue by 25% and its a huge success. The best part is; it is user friendly and helps my customer to trust my store more now. I can put subscription on specific product and its way easy than other apps. It also gives a dashboard to understand how my subscription is helping me and users too get their own screen to manage their subscription. all in all, a great app."	1288
129	4	2016-06-20T00:00:00Z	Bold is very hands on making the set up process simple. I would recommend using it.	1289
129	5	2016-06-18T00:00:00Z	"App works as described. Support personnel helped to install the recurring orders app for free. This was greatly appreciated. 

Thanks Bradley"	1290
130	5	2016-06-17T00:00:00Z	Bold's support team set up the Recurring Orders & Subscriptions App for me quickly and was very helpful to help me get started. The App have many features that I like and the user interface makes customizing your store fairly easy.	1291
130	3	2016-06-15T00:00:00Z	"This was a solid app but it wasn't for me. Support was OK the first time, then it trailed off.

I would definitely recommend it."	1292
130	1	2016-06-09T00:00:00Z	"I liked this app a lot when I first began using it! It has a great interface and is fairly intuitive. It also has pretty solid customization options for creating a variety of subscription packages.

But a rather annoying issue came up recently- I had a customer call me for the first subscription order I ever received over the phone. Most customers usually order online. She really didn't feel like placing it on the site, so I was happy to help her place the order over the phone.

I went into the back-end of my Shopify site, as suggested by Shopify for placing phone orders (placing a high volume of orders through the front end of your site can cause it to be flagged, as all of those sales end up being tied to one IP address). After I placed, fulfilled, and shipped the order, I noticed it did not come up in the Bold Recurring Orders app. I chatted with them shortly after, only to find out that manually entering orders into the back-end of Shopify does not communicate with their application. Mind you, the product I sold was a pure subscription-only product. This was something I was certainly not expecting, and made me lose some confidence in the app.

Long story short, I ended up being left out to dry and was only able to charge my customer's card one time for one month of a recurring subscription she was very excited to receive. There is no remedy for orders placed this way through this Bold app- and it made my company look bad in my opinion. It's quite an embarrassing phone call to make. Luckily, I just started running AdWords campaigns around my subscription offer- or else this issue could have scaled massively.

I hope someone reads this and is able to avoid the annoying situation I am currently dealing with! I might switch apps, depending on the quantity of phone orders I get for my krill oil subscription going forward. If you don't plan on getting phone orders, this app should work quite well for your store!

Good luck :)

130	5	2016-06-09T00:00:00Z	Well, so far so good.  I haven't set up any subscriptions yet and am just in my first baby steps with this app, but the customer service is great.  Brendon (hope I spelled your name right) was quick and efficient in helping get that liquid thingy set up for me.  (See, I told you I was in my first baby steps.)  Thanks guys, looking forward to plowing in and seeing how it works.	1294
130	5	2016-06-08T00:00:00Z	I had a question about how to change our recurring default to be monthly, instead of weekly. The support team was very quick to respond and resolve the issue. I have been able to increase my sales because of this app and I love that I can project out how much money I will be receiving because of the recurring orders that my customers have setup.	1295
130	5	2016-06-08T00:00:00Z	I had a question about adding a product to our subscription service, and Corey swiftly responded to my inquiry and sent screenshots to show me exactly how to fix the issue. I was impressed with his quick response and thorough explanation. Thanks COREY!	1296
130	5	2016-06-07T00:00:00Z	Great app and amazing support. Brendon and Cory from the tech team were awesome at helping to set everything up. Love the BOLD crew. Their apps just work. Just use them.	1297
130	5	2016-06-07T00:00:00Z	Brenden Rocks! Thank you for getting our site up and running so quickly.	1298
130	5	2016-06-06T00:00:00Z	Love the app. It's very easy to manage customers and orders. Looking forward to working with app to increase our sales and build customer loyalty.	1299
130	5	2016-06-06T00:00:00Z	Super fast service. the Bold team is very responsive. When I purchased my app it said it could take up for 4 business days to install the liquid code, but it was completed in a few hours.	1300
131	5	2016-06-06T00:00:00Z	"Awesome app. Fast & Free installation :) + Easy to make design/language changes. - I wish you could set the whole cart to subscription only.

Thank you Brenden and Victoria for your amazing help"	1301
131	3	2016-06-05T00:00:00Z	The app is great however It has to be easier to install for the non-tech savvy.	1302
131	5	2016-06-02T00:00:00Z	"Recurring orders look and work great.  For an example check out our page - https://ilmorso.com/products/americano

I love that they did the tricky liquid installation for us (it took 24 hours, not the 72 they promised).  Also, their support seems to be on point.  We had a small formatting issue which was resolved within a few hours."	1303
131	5	2016-10-27T00:00:00Z	"GREAT customer service. Even responded to us on a holiday! Always working just like my business! love it

Brenden was awesome and set me up in less than a day."	1304
131	5	2016-05-27T00:00:00Z	"So, there's this Bold Support Wizard named Brenden and he is, well, AMAZING. He's prompt, brilliant at what he does and knows the support system inside out. I can not recommend Bold highly enough and hope that you decide to use them... immediately! 

Cheers to great support and a very bright future for Ecommerce!"	1305
131	5	2016-05-27T00:00:00Z	BOLD's recurring order app is amazing, and the support (Thank you, Corey!) is 5 star service. This app allows me to offer my clients a monthly delivery option, and the coolest part is that they can chose their intervals- most of my customers chose their recurring order every 2 months. I think that's a brilliant option and I can;t say enough about this app and BOLD as a company. Truly a brilliant team and services, if you're a small business owner or commerce business, you need this app.	1306
131	5	2016-05-27T00:00:00Z	"i &^&*& LOVE recurring orders. seriously.  i was really frustrated by constantly having to track down sales of repeat customers. people loved our product but they would forget to reorder. and we were so busy we wouldn't reach out as often as we should. the result: LOST sales. NO MORE!!!!! we realized RO was a serious game changer for us once we had reached over 5K in future sales with only our first 6 signups. and with NO advertising on our part. just boom. can't wait til we actually start pushing the program. even our wholesalers have jumped on, which means fewer sales calls, and allows us to track down more new accounts and automate them!! every time we get a new RO i literally call my partners and just take a moment to celebrate. we are finally able to grow the way we should and RO is a HUGE part of that. not to mention once we look for investors, it will be so nice to be able to show them good evidence of future earnings. RO- like i said, we &^**&^*& LOVE you.

truth be told, we tried another leading subscription app and the customer service was abysmal. in contrast, bold apps kept reaching out to US to see how they could help us! victoria has been sooo kind and helpful. we had some issues with setup because of the way our store needed to bundle things, and she kept helping us refine it and refine it til we figured it out. now it is super smooth and bringing in the bucks!  a BIG thank you from theyesbar.com."	1307
131	5	2016-09-11T00:00:00Z	I love this BOLD app because it allows me to set my emails and subscriptions on autopilot! The customer service is awesome and always fast! The app is super easy to use too! Thanks Bold!	1308
131	5	2016-05-25T00:00:00Z	"We needed this for our GPS Vehicle Tracking business, to be able to bill our customers monthly, every month.  Quickbooks offers a recurring invoice but it is NOT user friendly, not automated, and not for me!!  Automation is the key to streamlining things, and this app does the job perfectly. They are always coming out with new features, and updates as well.  Thanks for a great app!

131	5	2016-05-25T00:00:00Z	excited to get started using Recurring Orders for my Detox Tea Caps.  Just signed up for the 90 day free trail, so far, really easy!	1310
132	5	2016-05-25T00:00:00Z	Thank you Brenden for installing the liquid code on my recurring orders app! It was done the same day and I now have my subscription product up and running!	1311
132	5	2016-05-24T00:00:00Z	"Love this app! The recurring subscription, stats, features and all the bells and whistles is more than i expected and we are impressed. You've got a long term customer here! This blew away our expectations and then some. Best app out for anyone with a subscription based business. Thanks again!

132	5	2016-05-24T00:00:00Z	Many thanks to Brenden from Bold Apps. He got us setup so quickly and during Canada's Victoria holiday. Very happy with the work done to style it up a bit to match our theme.	1313
132	5	2016-05-24T00:00:00Z	Great job to the Team at bold. Brendan got us setup so quickly. Very happy with the service and with the quality of the product. This will make everything so much easier for our team. http://www.ultra-shake.com	1314
132	5	2016-05-23T00:00:00Z	So far, this app has greatly simplified our store and our subscription options, yet providing more services to our customers! A refreshing change from our previous subscription options.	1315
132	5	2016-05-20T00:00:00Z	"Does what it says with lots of options to customize it perfectly.

The support team installed all the code for me within a couple days and it has been working flawlessly since.

Would definitely recommend using this app if you're thinking about it!"	1316
132	5	2016-05-17T00:00:00Z	It's a really great product, but the service is even better. Brenden installed it less than 24 hours after I put in the request!	1317
132	5	2016-05-16T00:00:00Z	Brenden was a great help installing my liquid code for this app!	1318
132	5	2016-05-13T00:00:00Z	Fantastic support - went above and beyond to help with our site's customizations!	1319
132	5	2016-05-30T00:00:00Z	So far so great! As soon as I figure out what I'm doing incorrectly, I'll be happier. Your team is being very helpful in assisting me. I'm grateful for their patience and understanding. I'm afraid to move over my subscribers from another platform because I'm not quite sure what I'm doing yet. We're getting there. Thanks for reaching out.	1320
133	5	2016-05-13T00:00:00Z	This app is the perfect solution to our e-cig cartridge AutoShip program. The app was installed promptly by Brenden the same day we ordered it! Had a little issue with the ajax shopping cart at first, but their support team (Josh & Victoria) quickly fixed it for us. We're very happy with this app so far.	1321
133	5	2016-05-13T00:00:00Z	I love this app and their support team. Very helpful for any issue..	1322
133	5	2016-05-13T00:00:00Z	"Really love this app for our website! Simple to use setup and very customizable. Also, great for our website, which is able to offer subscription offers. 5 Stars

-Daniel"	1323
133	5	2016-05-12T00:00:00Z	We having been using Recurring orders for sometime on our web site www.myanimal.co.uk to manage our dog food orders. It has made our life so easy in sorting out our subscription based ordering systems. Also offer great support. Loving all the new improvements. well done. www.myanimal.co.uk	1324
133	5	2016-09-28T00:00:00Z	I love this app! Setup was easy - Bold staff set us up quickly. The app makes it easy to sell and manage subscriptions. Once a customer purchases a subscription, they can manage their subscription with ease - changing payment options, ship dates, and more, leaving you more time to work on your business. We have been using this app for over 7 months now and love it. It is an integrated part of our business and has added a nice boost to our sales every month.	1325
133	5	2016-05-11T00:00:00Z	Absolutely amazing App works perfectly and the customer service is fantastic.	1326
133	5	2016-05-10T00:00:00Z	Excellent Addition to our store! Easy to use and Integrate.	1327
133	5	2016-05-10T00:00:00Z	"Absolutely, Ron was quick to respond and assist with the set up of the app on my website. 
I really appreciated his assistance. 
Great work!"	1328
133	5	2016-05-09T00:00:00Z	Bold Apps knocks it out of the park every time, but I'm really loving the Recurring Orders app.  I had used a subscription site previously, and it was super complicated.  The Recurring orders app integrates so well into my website and is making it really easy for me to do business!!!  AND - I have to say the service they provide is OUTSTANDING!!!  I am not a techie - I can accomplish the basics, but am lost otherwise.  The Bold Apps group is very responsive and always take care of me.  I will be going to Bold Apps first for any apps I need to install.	1329
133	5	2016-05-06T00:00:00Z	So far, so good. I'm looking forward to additional features being added to help build our customer base. As a start-up with very little funds we appreciate the 90-day free trial while we're figuring out how best to sell & market our product. I'm also impressed with the service and knowledge. Hoping to see recurring orders from customers very soon! Thanks guys!	1330
134	5	2016-05-05T00:00:00Z	Very helpful! Setting up is easy to use and service is great! Love adding subscriptions.	1331
134	5	2016-05-04T00:00:00Z	Are you kidding? Perfect! Just what we were looking for! Keep up the good work.	1332
134	5	2016-05-21T00:00:00Z	Great App, looking forward to many recurring customers Excellent  work guys	1333

134	5	2016-05-03T00:00:00Z	We just got started with Bold Apps and their Subscription model - its great! Customer support has been awesome. Looking forward to many subscriptions from here on out!	1335
134	5	2016-05-02T00:00:00Z	Awesome app!!! Navigating through it is SO easy, and the support staff is very helpful! They give you a guide for EVERYTHING on the site. I'm very new to writing code (dropped out of my coding class because I didn't understand it) but the step by step guide made it simple even for me to add the code necessary to integrate the app with Shopify! Pop ups come up on every new screen to let me know exactly what to do. I love this app!!!	1336
134	1	2016-05-02T00:00:00Z	Think about it twice before using this app. Horrendous support! No support staff available on weekends so if something goes wrong with their system (which is very glitchy to begin with) too bad for the customer. Their system failed this past weekend so no recurring orders were processed. I was unable to reach anybody until the following Monday, missing on a very large chunk of revenue. They fail to understand that companies depend on their product and do not take responsibility for the performance of their software.	1337
134	5	2016-05-01T00:00:00Z	Great app simple and easy to use.. thanks guys	1338
134	5	2016-04-29T00:00:00Z	Corey and the rest of the team at Bold Apps provide superior customer service! I have installed their Recurring Orders app and couldn't be happier with the end product. Anything you need, they will take great care of you. Corey was fast to respond and handled my support questions/requests very quickly. Do not hesitate to install this app and if you're looking for great support, contact Corey!	1339
134	5	2016-04-28T00:00:00Z	"Absolutely awesome product. Easy to use and very effective.

Thanks"	1340
135	5	2016-04-28T00:00:00Z	quick install, great customer service	1341
135	5	2016-04-28T00:00:00Z	Benn using this app for almost 12 Months now and haven't had any problems. Fast response, easy navigation and by far the most effective app we use on our shopify site. Thank-you!	1342
135	5	2016-04-28T00:00:00Z	The Bold support team is super helpful. It took a while to get everything working correctly, but Tyson was very friendly and eager to help in all problems. Recommended!	1343
135	5	2016-04-27T00:00:00Z	"Love this app, but more importantly - I love the quick and straightforward support.  Bold has responded in a reasonable time and been able to help me get the recurring orders app up and running smoothly and integrated easily into my store.  The back end is really easy to navigate and operate.

Would recommend this to anyone running a subscription service."	1344
135	5	2016-04-27T00:00:00Z	"So, like, wow. First thing, we had to add a payment gateway because, well we did and the squad at Bold came to the table quick and took care of that in no time. In fact they had it ready weeks ahead of launching our subscription program. 

Second, the service and assistance getting everything running smooth was tops. The app itself is strong, super clean interface and user friendly. I couldn't recommend these guys / this app more. Go Bold.

It has been nothing but great working with Victoria and Brendan (Ron) to get this app up and running. The liquid was installed within seconds. Thanks again Brendan! We are closer to getting more meals in the hands of our subscribers. 

I also love the fact that we are working with such a great company in our community. Keep up the great work guys!

135	5	2016-04-26T00:00:00Z	The product is fab, and the support is even better.  Brad is the greatest, he was so responsive and he made sure we got taken care of in a timely manner.  Anything he couldn't fix immediately, he was such to make sure he found a solution soon thereafter.	1347
135	5	2016-04-26T00:00:00Z	"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP - SUPPORT WIZARD BRENDEN (RON) & THE APP ITSELF ARE TOP NOTCH - #WINNING. #WHOOP #WHOOP 
The app is 100% headache free. Loving it. 
Thanks BRENDEN (RON)  for installing the liquid code WITHIN SECONDS......."	1348
135	5	2016-04-23T00:00:00Z	Love the application, our business www.getsocked.com.au wouldnt be around today if it wasnt for this app. So easy to use and understand! Highly recommended	1349
135	5	2016-04-20T00:00:00Z	"Thanks Ron for installing the Recurring Orders App for me. I tried and failed, looks like you got it up perfectly. 

Everything looks great!"	1350
136	5	2016-04-20T00:00:00Z	"The Confessional Boutique Wine Revelations is a group of small batch, boutique winemakers in McLaren Vale, South Australia. In each case, our producers are passionate about their wines and more often than not their wines are a reflection of their own personality as well as the vagaries of seasons, regional characteristics and grape varieties.

At our cellar door we recently launched the Illuminati Club - which offers members exclusive invites, wine releases and discounts. When members join up they select the frequency they wish their recurring wine order to arrive and with their first order they are sent sent a welcome letter, free gift and the Illuminati talisman.

We have been using Shopify for a while now for our online store and when we launched the Illuminati Club we were desperately looking for a way to have the same order process online that we do at the cellar door - so we were delighted when we found out about the Recurring Orders app from Bold!

Basically our starting point was we wanted to be able to entice new members online and do this by showing them the price advantage that they would get by joining the Illuminati Club. Showing a discount price is not hard (we could have done this ourselves) but the hard part is to have a simple system that lets people sign up to the club, select how often they want their order to arrive, automatically generate the order, process payment and assign our Illuminati Club members into specific tags/groups in our customer database. On top of this we wanted a way that our Illuminati could manage their own recurring orders that gives them the flexibility to manage their own subscription and recurring orders and have a system that we could forecast our recurring sales. 

The Recurring Orders App from Bold does all this and more and runs our Illuminati Club like a dream!

If you are looking for an app that seamlessly works with Shopify, easily manages recurring orders across all different types of products or carts, is straight forward  to set up and will grow your business then this app is for you.

We have not had to deal directly with the support team to date but in terms of the support and set up documentation provided it was great!

Like most Shopify apps, there is a bit of configuring required to set up and customise the Recurring Orders app but this is easily managed in-house. The install documentation and help text is very clear and we were able to easily install and configure the app ourselves."	1351
136	5	2016-04-20T00:00:00Z	This app adds much needed functionality to Shopify and the team at BOLD was a great help to get the setup perfect.	1352
136	5	2016-04-20T00:00:00Z	Great app! Super easy to install and the staff is very helpful with any questions about functionality and design.	1353
136	5	2016-04-18T00:00:00Z	"Great app and even better customer service! I thought it would be an issue that they can't be contacted via phone but their response time with e-mail is almost instant and it means I don't have to awkwardly wait on hold while someone figures out a technical problem with my store!

Corey helped me today. I told him the issues we were experiencing with our website and our subscriptions. He went in and fixed the entire problem and just e-mailed me back to let me know it was fixed.

Crisis averted! =)

Thanks!"	1354
136	5	2016-04-14T00:00:00Z	Great programs and support is very helpful in getting you up and running.  These guys get it!	1355
136	5	2016-04-13T00:00:00Z	Ron installed the liquid code for this app within minutes of me requesting it. The app itself looks pretty good!	1356
136	5	2016-04-13T00:00:00Z	love it! great customer support and great software!	1357
136	5	2016-04-11T00:00:00Z	Brad has been extremely helpful in getting my app set up the way I want and make it look cohesive with my site. Thanks for the great job!	1358
136	5	2016-04-11T00:00:00Z	"https://apps.shopify.com/recurring-orders

Koodos to Ron! He helped me install my app in just 1 day. I highly recommend this app it's easy to manage and they install it for you for free."	1359
136	5	2019-01-23T00:00:00Z	The customer service with Bold has always been exceptional. We are in contact regularly with Bold to assist us with managing our online subscriptions and we have never had a poor experience. Bold staff go above and beyond with detailed explanations, videos, and follow-ups. Most recently Rushit was able to help us sort out an issue and was very helpful.	1360
137	5	2016-04-07T00:00:00Z	Ron was Guru++ Level with his support; ultra fast and ultra competent.  Great job Ron, thanks!!	1361
137	5	2016-04-07T00:00:00Z	Thanks, Ron and the team for great service!	1362
137	5	2016-04-06T00:00:00Z	Awesome Product, Great and Fast Support! Thank you!	1363
137	5	2016-04-05T00:00:00Z	Great customer support! We needed a couple of modifications for the popout cart to work correctly and Rebecca got this done in just a couple of days. Very impressed!	1364
137	5	2016-04-04T00:00:00Z	"The support at Bold is NEXT LEVEL!!! Jason and the support team are incredible. They will do everything and everything in their to help out whether you're a prospective customer or current user. 

It's refreshing to get support with turnarounds and engagement at their level. I bet their support would write up a haiku for you if you asked. Super happy I found Bold."	1365
137	5	2016-04-19T00:00:00Z	Fairly easy setup and great customer support.  Most people will require the assistance of their tech team to set this up though.  Overall, it does what it's supposed to do, which is allow  you to set up recurring payments on your products.  Seems to work very well.	1366
137	5	2016-04-04T00:00:00Z	"We did a lot of research before settling on Recurring Orders for our subscription products, and what we found was, as with all Bold Apps, this one had the greatest functionality for our the price.

Another strong plus for the app is Bold Apps themselves. We have several apps from Bold, and as always, the support is faultless. It is first class, prompt and well executed.

The app itself is still new for us, and we are only just starting to get to know our way around it and its features. It does the simple recurring orders task we need, it's super easy to configure, and once Kevin had coded in the look we wanted to match our store it has all gone smoothly.

The only negative i found to date is that it doesn't integrate with Shopify Payments and we had to open a Stripe account despite Shopify Payments being already powered by Stripe. However, with ongoing developments on this app, it wont surprise to see Bold Apps add Shopify Payments to their gateway options very soon.

Highly recommended if you're looking for the best subscription app."	1367
137	5	2016-04-03T00:00:00Z	Very positive experience with this app.  Our store is solely a subscription business model and Recurring Payments works very well.  The team is helpful although time differences make a response relatively slow but that's not a dig, it's just down to me living in a different time zone!	1368
137	4	2016-04-03T00:00:00Z	"We have worked hard to complete our webstore and bold apps has been there to help us along the way.  We have been involved in what seem to be ""edge cases"" where we have found some bugs that were specific to our application and Bold has responded well."	1369
137	4	2016-04-03T00:00:00Z	Off to a great new start. This app surly will make my life and marketing that much easier....	1370
138	5	2016-04-03T00:00:00Z	"I've been very impressed so far with Recurring Orders. 
The most impressive element for me has been the level and quality of customer support. I've asked a lot of questions and every time they've been answered quickly and have given me a solution. They really do care about their customers.

What's also great is that Bold Aps are continuing to update and improve the app with many new features. Looking forward to trying them.

Would highly recommend and recurring subscription solution!"	1371
138	5	2016-04-02T00:00:00Z	The recurring orders is a way for us to help our customers build a consistent certified organic and natural skin and hair care routine. We also offer certified dog care shampoo, conditioner, and flea, fly, & tick repellent and having subscriptions keep the pet owners supplied with our quality organic products. Check out how the app works on our website and get yourself on our subscription list for Pacific Northwest made, certified organic, and all natural skin and hair care products. Get started on caring for yourself without the worry of ordering more products let our auto subscription take care of that for you.	1372
138	5	2016-04-14T00:00:00Z	A huge shout out goes to David! He handled and took care of all my questions and concerns with a quickness! BOLD even went the extra step and customized the look to match the feel of my theme. Thank you, thank you, thank you!	1373
138	1	2016-04-01T00:00:00Z	So far this is a complete piece of shit.  I'd have given it 0 stars if I could've.	1374
138	4	2016-04-01T00:00:00Z	"Pretty good service
My only critique is that once an order is set in, you cant go back and change it. 
I had a customer who wanted to pick up his subscription instead of having it shipped, but I was unable to go in and stop the shipping charge."	1375
138	5	2016-03-31T00:00:00Z	fantastic app and the staff are really helpful and got me setup in no time!	1376
138	5	2016-03-29T00:00:00Z	I love this app!  It's very easy to use and provides everything we would like for managing our subscription sales.	1377
138	5	2016-03-29T00:00:00Z	Brenden was very helpful! This app is exactly what we have been looking for to be able to customize to the needs and requests of our customers as well as our own needs. Many of the details have already been addressed by BOLD and this app has moved our store on a very progressive path. Thank Brenden and Team BOLD!	1378
138	5	2016-03-27T00:00:00Z	Bold subscription app works very well for my subscription based company.	1379
138	5	2016-03-24T00:00:00Z	Brenden was really helpful! I love the app. So many choices. I love the video explanations, I can play and replay to set the app the way I want!	1380
139	1	2016-03-24T00:00:00Z	The login rarely worked for customers. Customer service was unhelpful. Overall waste of money. I should add this has gone on for months with little assistance.	1381
139	5	2016-03-24T00:00:00Z	very helpful, bold has been able to change any setting i need so far. great for subscriptions	1382
139	5	2016-03-24T00:00:00Z	"Where do I start.... This app is amazing so far! Brenden, Brad and David were a great help to me. The app is easy to use once you get the hang of it. It looks good on my website and the developers were able to code the app to suit my current theme! I was also having little glitches with the app and they didn't hesitate to help me with whatever I needed. I anticipate a long future with them if they keep this up. You won't regret getting this app! 

Priscilla | Founder | www.goldengenesisboutique.co.uk"	1383
139	5	2016-03-23T00:00:00Z	Great App! does exactly as it should! very customizable, and cool coupons codes!	1384
139	5	2016-03-23T00:00:00Z	"RAVE Coffee is a specialty coffee roaster and the ability for us to be able to offer subscriptions to our customers is a huge advantage over our competitors. We used to offer subscriptions and monitor these manually through a spreadsheet but the process was lengthy and prone to error. Having this system automated through the Shopify order system means that no customer can no longer be forgotten.

A better experience for the customer means they are more likely to purchase the product again and in return provide an increase in our revenues.

Whenever we have asked for a modification on how the app works and appears the support team have been able to address these concerns within 48 hours"	1385
139	5	2016-05-04T00:00:00Z	"UPDATE: These guys are the best! If you are looking for a subscription tool look no further!  They have a rock solid team that's always there for anything you need and the app just works perfectly as well. They have been so helpful since we got started with them that I can't express my gratitude enough. 

Kevin, Brad, Corey, and Victoria have been awesome to deal with. They are incredibly responsive and I've never had such hands on help from an app developer. Highly recommend this."	1386
139	5	2016-03-23T00:00:00Z	"Wow, Iv been looking at this app for a while but had no idea how much it would change the way we manage our subscriptions. These guys have thought of everything. Our store will never be the same again. 

Thank you so much

139	5	2016-03-23T00:00:00Z	Brenden helped me setting up this app, and it worked great!	1388
139	5	2016-03-22T00:00:00Z	Love the app, customer service is OFF THE CHAIN excellent. Would definitely recommend.	1389
139	5	2016-09-08T00:00:00Z	"UPDATE 09/08/2016
This app works wonderfully, support is great LOVE IT!

UPDATE 7/11/16

App is still performing excellently! Easy to use, support is awesome and best of all my customers love it!

UPDATE:

I recently switched from 3dcart to Shopify. Used a recurring order module that 3dcart offered, it was horrible. The recurring order module offered by Bold is far superior. They installed the app, quickly answered any questions and now it just runs seemlessly. This is a new store for me so I cannot offer much historical data on sales, but so far the feedback from my customers has all been positive.

The support team has been great. Quick to respond, knowledgable and easy to work with.

Brenden got my code installed and I am off and running to customize the app for my customers. Support has been great, quick to respond. Love this app thanks guys. Experienced a few hick-ups along the way, but so far so good."	1390
140	1	2016-03-21T00:00:00Z	"Be careful, if you try the app and you do not like it and then remove it, their files will stay stuck to your website until they remove it for you and they are not really very helpful when you want to leave them and not use their app. 
Their app is not efficient, rather a very basic one you can find anywhere for free. I warn you to stay away from them."	1391
140	5	2016-03-21T00:00:00Z	Brenden was super helpful and so far Bold has been fantastic alternative to some of the other products we've tried in the past. Thanks so much!	1392
140	5	2016-03-21T00:00:00Z	Great App - works as designed and the support team is always available to help.	1393
140	5	2016-03-20T00:00:00Z	"Great app ... it has generated a lot of extra regular income .. great support at the start as well 
thanks to Bold !"	1394
140	5	2016-07-25T00:00:00Z	"After 30+ years in business selling our variety of machine shop related software using the traditional, PC based model ... we were looking to take them to the cloud. We needed to set-up an online store that had the capabilities of handling recurring subscriptions. We set-up our Shopify store based on the Recurring Orders App specifically ... and it has met or exceeded all our expectations. Easy to use ... feature rich ... it has allowed us to get our cloud / subscription based model up and running quickly and easily. The app handles all the recurring charges and reporting with very little effort on our part ... allowing us to concentrate on software development and customer experience.

The initial experience of getting the app integrated and up and running was handled quickly and we were kept informed at every step of the process. Support? What support? The app just works ... period."	1395
140	5	2016-03-18T00:00:00Z	"I can highly recommend the team behind this app. We installed the recurring orders in a modified shopify theme, so there were some issues which arose in installation. The team quickly responded to all of our issues and corrected all the bugs which our modified theme caused. 

The team has been very friendly and professional in their approach and I would not hesitate to use them again for other apps."	1396
140	5	2016-03-16T00:00:00Z	Awesome App! This is just what I needed for my subscription-based service. Brenden set up the app for me and had it done the same day! Easy to use and I'm able to customize most of the features.	1397
140	5	2016-03-16T00:00:00Z	"Really awesome apps. Lets customers select products on a schedule best for them. Minion Made really knew who they were recommending with this, BOLD has been great! 

Kudos to BOLD (http://boldcommerce.com) & Minion Made (http://minionmade.com)."	1398
140	5	2016-03-14T00:00:00Z	"Brendan and team at Bold really came through for me!

Great customer service is the icing on the cake of a app this is SO POWERFUL!  Highly recommend anyone in ecommerce to consider this app - it will pay for itself!"	1399
140	5	2016-03-13T00:00:00Z	"My customer's love that their subscriptions never expire and they don't miss out on updates. Recurring orders was very easy to setup and works perfectly. I looked at just about every subscription management software on the web before purchasing from Bold Apps. This app saves me hours of time every month not having to send expiration notices.
David"	1400
141	1	2019-08-10T00:00:00Z	"Support and communication with developers massively lacking.  

I've been using this app for 3 years and all of a sudden, WITHOUT NOTIFICATION, they changed my plan and started charging commissions on my subscription setup.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and would not recommend these developers as they do not notify customers regarding changes in their policies and charges.  Do not download."	1401
141	4	2016-03-10T00:00:00Z	"Great app so far!  Gets the job done and has pretty decent reporting.  The support team is great - really helped us get it going.  Wish I could do a couple more things like create customer referral codes so customers can refer their friends & apply a discount/ coupon to an existing subscription - but seems like the team is working on more stuff.

I evaluated every other subscription app for Shopify and this was definitely the best one out there."	1402
141	5	2016-03-10T00:00:00Z	Quick and fantastic service! Did an amazing job integrating into www.beerdiron.com! Thank you!!!	1403
141	5	2016-03-10T00:00:00Z	Thank you bold & thank you Angele especially! My liquid was installed so fast and I was rocking and rolling in no time. Great service!	1404
141	5	2016-03-10T00:00:00Z	Amazing app. Support was awesome in setting everything up!	1405
141	5	2016-03-10T00:00:00Z	This app works perfect for our monthly subscriber base.  They are always updating it with new features!	1406
141	5	2016-03-08T00:00:00Z	We have loved using this app in our store and the number of subscriptions we have gotten!	1407
141	5	2016-03-08T00:00:00Z	I really love this app. It's made offering auto-ship to my customers super easy. The dashboard is easy to figure out. Customizing the widget and email notifications that go out was also very easy. Kevin was great at answering my questions on things I couldn't figure out. Will be looking at other BOLD apps to see if there is anything else I can use.	1408
141	5	2016-03-08T00:00:00Z	"Just getting to grips with this package.  The free trial makes it a no brainer.

Staff have been really helpful and the package looks great."	1409
141	5	2016-03-08T00:00:00Z	I love the app. So simple to use and so beneficial to my online store. Brenden from Bold support was a huge help in early set up, he provided excellent advice and very quick response time. I am extremely happy with the service.	1410
142	5	2016-03-07T00:00:00Z	Support has been super helpful and they configured my app really quickly.	1411
142	5	2016-03-22T00:00:00Z	"Easy, Smooth, Professional, Efficient, Brilliant ! :) Great customer service, dilligent with the follow up and happy to help :)

All I can say is thank you for being part of the 1%, like myself my business prides itself on quality & providing above & beyond customer satisfaction :)

They are quite simply there 24/7 to deal, handle & resolve anything you need asap. They just get S*%t done! Perfect."	1412
142	5	2016-03-06T00:00:00Z	"We cannot recommend Bold and their Recurring Orders app enough! The app does everything we wanted it too straight out of the box (well, installation) and there are are so many great features, we're still learning just how powerful the app is.
Oh, and we shouldn't forget  the simply outstanding customer service we've received from the guys @ Bold. Simply brilliant, they've been an absolute pleasure to work with. We were so impressed, we're now trying to work out how we can integrate more of their apps into our store!"	1413
142	5	2016-03-06T00:00:00Z	Install was a breeze thanks to their excellent customer support.	1414
142	5	2016-03-05T00:00:00Z	Great app. Super support and communication.	1415
142	4	2016-03-05T00:00:00Z	Corey was terrific! He kept following up on me to make sure the BOLD subscription app was working properly and showing up on my site. I was amazed by his level of customer service. Most companies you wait for days for help. Not with BOLD. They truly adhere to the principle of caring for their customers. Corey was outstanding! Thank you. ; )	1416
142	5	2016-03-03T00:00:00Z	"a really great app - installed quicky and easy to set up!  Great way to get recurring purchases.

Good job guys!"	1417
142	5	2016-03-03T00:00:00Z	works great. complicated system, but does a lot! :-) best option on the marketplace.	1418
142	5	2016-03-02T00:00:00Z	Easy access to the support team has us hooked. Customers loving the functionality doesn't hurt either!	1419
142	5	2017-03-01T00:00:00Z	"We use recurring orders by Bold at www.coffeecanopy.com.  It's a great app that allows us to provide subscription options to our customers.  This app has it all: 
You can tailor the discount to each product, product group, or collection.  
You can tailor the frequency selections that your customer can choose from.
You can also customize the look and feel of the widgets.
We also love that it shows you the estimated sales on the dashboard for the next 7 days, the next 30 days, and the next 365 days.  It's a great way to visualize the amount of potential future sales in subscriptions alone.

These are only a few of the great features this app provides.  Try it out, you won't be disappointed.  Bold even had one of their techs install it for us for free as we had some issues with the liquid installation as our theme is not very standard.  They installed it for free within about 24 hours of us requesting it.  Now that's customer service!!!

***Update as of 3/1/2017***
Bold is constantly updating the recurring orders app with new features! It's amazing that every time we start thinking about some feature we'd like to see, Bold is already adding it to the next version of the app. 

Our growth model primarily focuses on recurring orders. Bold's recurring orders dashboard not only gives us a great view of our subscriptions and expected sales, it also allows us to completely manage our customers and products. 

We've tried a few other subscription apps, but the recurring orders app is *BY FAR* the best. You won't be disappointed: it's easy to setup and easy to maintain.

143	5	2016-02-29T00:00:00Z	Great support team. Easy to implement and customize. Very pleased with the Recurring Orders app thus far.	1422
143	5	2016-02-26T00:00:00Z	Loving the customization features that the Recurring Orders App allows! As a small business owner, it's so convenient to be able to go in & change things myself on my website instead of wait for (or have to pay) a professional web guy. Thanks Bold for creating an easy to use app!!	1423
143	5	2016-02-25T00:00:00Z	Just started & loving this app already. Can see some very big things happening for me while using this...	1424
143	5	2016-02-24T00:00:00Z	Great app, great support. They're very thorough, the app works like you'd expect and the support is top notch.	1425

The support team has been excellent with installation and anwsering all our questions. We would also suguest it to anyone. We are also going to use a couple of other Bold APPS."	1427

143	4	2017-02-06T00:00:00Z	I love Recurring Orders because it means my customers get delicious coffee delivered to their door every fortnight without any hassles at all. It comes regularly, they don't have to remember, they never run out. And it means regular orders and sales for me that provide peace of mind, guaranteed income, and all round coffee joy! The app just works, the customers can access it and change as they want, and all the recurring orders come through to my shopify app. Nice Work BOLD. Keep up the good work.	1430
144	5	2016-02-20T00:00:00Z	"The greatest overall function in this app is that it makes possible for me to offer consumers the exact offers QVC, Evine, HSN, Bose, Dell, Apple just to name a few, even thought I am a very small business owner that, primarily, use drop shippers. It allows me the option to actually cut the price in half, fours or eighths for that matter! Simply amazing, ""I Quote."" Simply cool. Very valuable for an up and coming online electronics store. I have gigantic corporations I  aspire. I am sure I need not go any further.:)  I wish you guys would create an app that will allow small online companies to offer credit cards or lines of credit to their customers! That is an app I'd spend my last dime on!
    I now use four of your apps, i.e., Bundle, Recurring, Marketplace, and Upsell. I am currently looking into your other apps. It appears Bold have all the apps ANY company/business needs in order to thrive in its' chosen market. Thanks Bold...

    Your Applications are simply created easy enough to place the code in my self. No, I am not the most Code Literate person one would meet. In Fact, I am oblivious to the reasoning of code and the wonders it results. But with Bold one simply need to read, that's it! In sort, I consider your staff to be Superb! Why? Well, your staff are part of the creation of the apps, which are simple enough to code on my own. So the support is ""Fore-Greate"" if that's even an appropriate term to use... :)

144	5	2016-02-20T00:00:00Z	Best Recurring Payment and Subscription App by far! Love the customer service at Bold. On point. :)	1432
144	5	2016-02-18T00:00:00Z	Excellent app to provide subscription service to your e-commerce site. We use Shopify and the integration was almost too simple. We were up and running in an hour or so and have almost no issue using the app.	1433
144	5	2016-02-17T00:00:00Z	Brenden helped me and downloaded the liquid code onto my shopify store and it was very quick! The support team has been very helpful and easy to use.	1434

My feedback is for the great support that recently discover to use with my shopify store.  I reach out for support with getting app install on my shopify store and receive immediate support and Brenden conplete my app install in less than 4-hours.  I am very very impress with this kind of support service, I never would have expected this kind of support.  I really think I am going to enjoy using the app and it will be help to my website customers. Thank you Brenden"	1435

144	5	2016-02-17T00:00:00Z	"My ""Story"" is simple - I am an ""older guy"" (much older) than any of these newer generations of folks that are using this wonderful internet thing (aka ""the web"") to do things in the world. I have accepted this in my life and decided to fully embrace this worldwide web and new fangled way of doing business. So when I do anything at all on the Line it simply MUST be as easy as possible and - how you say ""user Friendly"". To me it's sort of like electricty - I can't see it, and I don't understand how it works. But I know I need it in my house, so I use it. Well YOUR APP service program is SIMPLY THE BEST!
As soon as I clicked on the button to use this APP program it gave me all the simple instructions I needed to learn how to load it and use it. I was also given a video to watch that showed me what to do. Then I quickly got the support chat little box on my computer telling me more things to do to help and how to get direct help from you.
 I have used auto billing in my many businesses over many decades, and they can be magnificent revenue generating programs for ANY business. So when I decided to do this on the Line with my Shopify store selling my product ""TryptoNite"" (yes, MY Product. I invented it while in the U.S. Air Force), I needed a program that anyone could load and work. And believe you me - If I Can Do It, ANYONE Can DO IT! Also, your program does exactly what my ""brick and mortar"" programs have been doing for decades. Truth be told - your program is BETTER!
Thank you for helping all of us, especially the older senior generation like me.

Mohammad from Bold Apps You did a great job on the install!

Thanks again Bold Apps"	1438
144	5	2016-02-24T00:00:00Z	Many thanks to the Bold Team with special shout outs to Jay, Kevin and Eric for their help and support in getting the recurring app working seamlessly with my Shopify store. They are courteous, helpful and thoughtful in their approach. Recurring Apps is now the app I use for my subscription renewals, which is a fundamental part of our business model. They have a great support team and I appreciate the attentiveness.	1439
144	5	2016-02-09T00:00:00Z	Amazing Customer Service.  Thank You Kevin and Brendon!!!	1440
145	5	2016-02-08T00:00:00Z	Easy to install and super easy to use!  It's helped me grow my recurring revenue and gain customer loyalty.  If you have a product that needs to be auto refilled, this is a great app to add to your store!	1441

Thanks again Brenden and Bold Apps"	1442
145	3	2016-02-02T00:00:00Z	"The app works fairly well, and customers will buy through it. I do have two issues.

1. Tech support is great when you sign up and need the code installed. After that, it is slow and practically non-responsive. This has always been a gripe of mine at Bold.

2. The control panel is confusing to customers, and they cannot make changes to their subscription. If they can, they don't know how and neither do I.

Everything else is pretty good. The app does what it says and is well thought out. I have been able to build a subscription customer base with this app."	1443
145	5	2016-02-01T00:00:00Z	Just finished adding this app to my store, and the instructions were pretty easy to follow and they set everything up in a very timely manner. =) Can't wait to see this start working!	1444
145	5	2016-01-29T00:00:00Z	This app rocks! Just added it to my store and so for my new jerky product - it's perfect because it's not available in stores making the subscription capability a real plus. Great job guys!  Brenden who helped set up was fantastic.  Thanks Brenden!	1445
145	5	2016-01-29T00:00:00Z	Awesome app. Works exactly as advertised, and plenty of help available in the Help section. Love it.	1446
145	5	2016-05-12T00:00:00Z	The app seems to work well, Brenden did a great job installing the liquid very quickly!	1447
145	5	2016-05-29T00:00:00Z	We just launched a really neat subscription to our store - a monthly essential oil subscription box.  I was so happy to find this app to make this idea become a reality!  Easy to use and set up, very straight forward. Also, the support is very helpful.  Really loving this!	1448
145	5	2016-01-27T00:00:00Z	"Brendon from Bold has been a great help to me setting this up. I am new to this and he was super helpful and attentive. I recommend Brendon and this Bold App

145	5	2016-01-26T00:00:00Z	Just getting started, the set up and was done by them for free which is always a great addition. Henry was really helpful implementing and only took 2 days as apposed to the 5 they said which meant I could get going sooner. Ill certainly  come back and let people know how I am getting on later. http://www.broniandbo.co.uk/collections/mens-subscription-service	1450

146	5	2016-01-26T00:00:00Z	I would like to give a huge shout out to Rick for installing the liquid code on my store. He's very helpful, and easy to communicate with. I didn't expect that it would be quick to install the liquid codes on my store as I just made a request yesterday. So, Thank you so much Rick! I couldn't do this without you, as I'm really confused about the codes. You are awesome!	1452
146	1	2016-01-25T00:00:00Z	I have been trying to use this app with my shop. Tech support has been non responsive via email and there is no way to contact someone via telephone. I will not and cannot recommend this app due to the poor tech support.	1453
146	4	2016-01-20T00:00:00Z	love this app however customer service has incredibly poor on my end, I hope for it to improve in my new issues i am experiencing with them.	1454
146	5	2016-01-20T00:00:00Z	i love this app! the staff is super friendly and helpful. We have been able to implement a subscription program that has made our company so much more financially stable for minimum cost! thank you	1455

146	5	2016-01-19T00:00:00Z	"This is all I'd dreamed of and thought MUST be possible.
Mohammad at BOLD installed the liquid for us, and the app was easy to learn.
We had a couple of people to e-mail if we needed to, Mohammad was quick to answer e-mails and super competent and quick to do the liquid install. 
It is super functional and gives a clean look to the pages too.
I like not having the subscription 'time out' every 30 months. Now they can be set indefinitely and I can still change the price to reflect changing shipping costs through the years. I like the fact that my customers can suspend their shipment at times, or they can change the timing of deliveries as their needs change through the year.
Yes, this app is worth the resources, for it is a greater resource."	1460
147	5	2016-01-18T00:00:00Z	So far this is offering everything I've looked for in a recurring app. I really love the incorporation of coupon codes within this app. It just all flows so perfectly together!	1461
147	5	2016-01-16T00:00:00Z	This product has already produced a dozen or more subscribers and the initial trial period is not even finished!  Easy to use and understand, I would recommend this to friends with a store!	1462
147	5	2016-01-15T00:00:00Z	Installed the app. Didn't have time to do the ground work for setting it up and Brenden got my website www.livehislove.org all set up and ready to go. Thanks!	1463
147	5	2019-10-09T00:00:00Z	The technical support really goes above and beyond, thanks Alexa. You saved our bacon... err coffee.	1464
147	5	2016-01-12T00:00:00Z	These guys are the bomb.com. Major props to Brad, who was our support tech. I seriously can't rave enough about how awesome they were at helping us get our app up and running - they even did most of the customizations for me. Every time I emailed them with a question, they were back to me within an hour or two.	1465
147	5	2016-01-12T00:00:00Z	Brenden killed the liquid install.  If fact, I'm considering writing him in on my 2016 presidential ballot.  Brenden, you the real MVP.	1466

Thanks Chintan"	1469
147	5	2016-01-09T00:00:00Z	The Recurring Orders app goes well beyond the subscription features of our old Ecommerce webhost. We especially appreciate that we could get not just free installation of the app in our Shopify web store, but that Brenden customized the look of the app for our Shopify theme. Brenden saved us so much time that we otherwise would have spent tweaking and choosing options. Thank you, Bold Apps and Brenden!	1470
148	1	2016-01-07T00:00:00Z	DO NOT USE THIS APP.  Inventory forecasting does not work, which will cause you total chaos.  Has cost us thousands - you have been warned.	1471
148	5	2016-05-11T00:00:00Z	Corey was quick to respond and answer all my questions about Recurring Orders, which, BTW, is a pretty cool app. It's helped drive sales AND it's nice to see a list of upcoming monthly orders.	1472
148	5	2016-01-06T00:00:00Z	Mohammad was very quick with the installation and we really appreciate that!! Thanks, Mohammad!!	1473
148	5	2016-01-05T00:00:00Z	"Amazing job Warren :)

Thanks a lot!"	1474
148	5	2016-01-04T00:00:00Z	"I absolutely luv this app!  It's very user friendly and easy to use.  The staff are super friendly!  I would definitely use again and recommend to everyone, even the most inexperienced users.

Thank you Bold Apps ;)

148	5	2016-01-03T00:00:00Z	I can't express how happy I am with app! Kevin helped me so much in setting up my website to fully utilize this service. I am so happy to offer the subscribe and save option now, and I just had my first sale with it! The continued help from Kevin  has been a lifesaver for sure.  AMAZING experience, well worth the monthly fee. Thanks!	1476
148	5	2015-12-31T00:00:00Z	Great app! My customers are loving the ease of use and friendly interface. I find extremely valuable to have recurrent sales and predictability. On top of all, great Support from the Bold Apps team to make sure everything works properly.	1477
148	5	2015-12-31T00:00:00Z	"So easy...so customizable...with ability to easily replicate an ""Amazon-like"" experience that customers understand off the bat. 
Our business doesn't have the standard ""cookie cutter"" catalogue -- most of the other recurring apps for Shopify wouldn't meet our needs.
But I talked with Kevin at Bold and he explained how they could meet our needs....and when I hit trouble with the installation (I'm IT-clueless), Sarika from Bold came in and got it all sorted in an unbelievably quick period of time. Seriously happy!"	1478
148	5	2015-12-30T00:00:00Z	Love this App!  We sell insect food for reptiles (e.g. dubia roaches)  and instead of our customers having to continually log into our site to make the purchase, they can now have their pets food delivered to them like clock work.  Makes it so much easier for our customers.  Thank you for creating the valuable app.  You are making pets happy!	1479

149	5	2015-12-28T00:00:00Z	We love this app and would definitely recommend it. Recurring orders help with forecasting and it's a great way to create an instantaneous loyal customer! Great customer service from Kevin. Highly recommended.	1481
149	5	2016-01-11T00:00:00Z	I looked for (and tried!) so many apps to make my club subscriptions work and Recurring Orders is by far the best one I've found! It works really smoothly, is easy for customers to make changes and updates themselves, and integrates well with the rest of my website and shop. The only feature I wanted that they didn't have was calendar billing - and they just added that! This app is now perfect.	1482
149	5	2015-12-22T00:00:00Z	We needed a robust, reliable platform for managing our specialty coffee subscription service and BoldApps Recurring Orders delivered.  Integration with Shopify is excellent.  Customer support is professional and responsive.  We can't wait to launch this new service for our customers!	1483
149	5	2015-12-21T00:00:00Z	Great plugin and awesome customer support, i am loving everything so far!	1484
149	5	2015-12-21T00:00:00Z	Absolutely the best app we've tried for subscription orders. Easy interface, smooth & seamless integration, just wonderful all around.	1485
149	5	2015-12-21T00:00:00Z	"We have been so happy with Recurring Orders. Sometimes we barely feel like we can keep up with all the new features, we just added the new gift feature.

We love the stats and dashboards, it gives us a great look for how we are doing and is really exciting to see how many subscriptions we will have in the next 7 days and next 30 and 365.

Thanks so much!"	1486
149	4	2015-12-19T00:00:00Z	"Really great app and support. Had some issues at first and wish it better integrated with shopify data and conversion tracking. But I could not be happier.

149	5	2015-12-15T00:00:00Z	"This app  is able to manage a large number of subscription variations as well as other forms of purchase such as one-time gifts.  
Great support team and scheduled improvements make the app more robust.      

This app offers enough flexibility for online store newbies to use it now and support their store growth with more features and take it to the next level. 

I am glad you guys created this app!

Thanks so much!

Is OMG Super Cool an acceptable answer? :)"	1489
149	5	2015-12-13T00:00:00Z	Nice flexible app with easy-to-use interface. It was simple enough to install and we're expecting thousands in recurring revenue!	1490
150	5	2015-12-11T00:00:00Z	the fastest installation I've ever seen!	1491
150	5	2015-12-10T00:00:00Z	"We had chosen ReCharge over Recurring Apps because at the time they did not offer PayPal and we were already using PayPal. ReCharge like Recurring Apps did not bring over any information from Braintree such as Authorization Codes, Gateway information etc. This was causing us large amounts of manual data and we are about to do an account conversion. 

Unlike ReCharge they offered to do some customization to get this information for us. Even with programming cost it is much needed and essentially a requirement of our Finance Department. Since Aug we have already gained 500 Subscribers and hoped to continue this growth with Recurring Orders.

Well, we have been on Recurring Orders since Nov 1 and have already gained 225 subscription customers!  The conversion went great and Kevin was a great asset.  He worked with us through the entire process and set up the front end for us as well.  I can't say enough about how much they helped.  

I definitely recommend them.  We use many Bold Apps and will continue to."	1492
150	5	2015-12-10T00:00:00Z	Just started using it, and it looks great. It was setup within 2 days and looks fantastic, and it certainly brings in new business	1493
150	5	2015-12-08T00:00:00Z	"Thank you to Brenden for installing the liquid code for my recurring orders app.  I thought I did it right but I guess not.  Couldn't have done it without ya.  Thanks Brenden.

150	4	2015-12-08T00:00:00Z	Recurring Orders from Bold Apps opens up new opportunities for e-commerce. It's easy to use, gives some great insights with their data. Definitely worth trying out if you offer any type of product that the customer might repurchase.	1495
150	5	2015-12-08T00:00:00Z	When using an app like this, support is extremely important and Bold apps have been amazing throughout my whole setup process.  The app does (nearly) everything I need it too, and what it can't do, the amazing team have given me work arounds so i'm now good to go.  I highly recommend the app and the team!	1496
150	5	2015-12-08T00:00:00Z	I recently added Recurring Orders to my shop and I am loving the customer service I received from Mohammad. He installed my app and answered all questions I had! The liquid was installed in lesser time than I thought so I will turn the orders on very soon. I think this is something my customers will really enjoy.	1497
150	5	2015-12-07T00:00:00Z	Customer support has been amazing so far.  Plugging this into our shopify site has been simple.  Thank you Mohammad - he went above and beyond setting this up for us and getting us started.  Would definitely recommend.	1498
150	5	2016-10-07T00:00:00Z	"My store provides military care packages to deployed military members and this app was one of the best  choices I've made. This app allows the friends and family of service members to schedule care packages so that their Troop never has to be without. I can't thank you all enough. The service is a great option and the support is wonderful. Any time I have had questions they have been quick to help me. I greatly appreciate this app and the support team.

To add to this, I've changed my theme several times and the support team is always so great to reinstall for me. Most recently Anton not only installed this great app, but he also tried to make it flow better with my store theme which I really appreciate. I recommend this app and the customer support behind it. Thank you."	1499
150	5	2020-02-06T00:00:00Z	I switched from ReCharge and the old code was conflicting with BOLD but they were nice enough to delete it and fix for me! Awesome team	1500
151	5	2015-12-05T00:00:00Z	Kevin is great quick to answer questions an very helpful. I use train tech support with Apple and I can spoke a gem when I interact with one. Keep up the good work.	1501
151	5	2015-12-04T00:00:00Z	Very robust app that allowed us to easily set up single-time purchases and subscriptions along with ways to encourage the different options to customers. Support was quick and willing to help with anything we needed.	1502
151	5	2015-12-04T00:00:00Z	I needed support for applying the recurring order code on my shop and had phenomenal support. I'm sure the entire team is great at BOLD but a guy named 'Warren' in particular was fantastic. He personally sent me such a warm email and also offered his own help for future issues I'd have. Great guy!	1503
151	5	2015-12-03T00:00:00Z	"Finally! Ben is my hero. After days of confusion and frustration!  I was ready to give up and uninstall Bold Apps.  

Ben! Saved the day and may gain many other products businesses.  This is a great starting point for me to get started and looking forward to utility and explore many other Bold apps. 

I am very happy and satisfied with Ben customer services.  GREAT JOB!

151	5	2016-05-06T00:00:00Z	I'm looking forward to leveraging this app with our new notebook wallet so consumers can subscribe to get their monthly notebook refills every 6 months. The Bold Apps team was incredibly fast to get the app installed - Ron is a rock star!	1509
151	5	2015-12-02T00:00:00Z	Brenden was awesome in helping us install the app. Shouting out to him as a huge thank you. The app is amazing and we love it	1510
152	5	2015-12-02T00:00:00Z	"Your app is fantastic.  We sell personal hygiene products that are needed regularly by our customers.  As a result, the Recurring App meets all of our needs, and our customers with the easy selection of more regular home delivery orders.  What a gift to our business!  We are too new to assess the overall effect, but we are over-the-moon at being able to offer it - and with such ease.  Setting up a new e-commerce business is not easy but the Recurring App lifts the load and let's us concentrate on other pressing matters.
Your team was responsive and patient - but the installation was so easy, there really wasn't much for us, or them, to do!"	1511
152	5	2015-12-01T00:00:00Z	"I have to say I am impressed! I work on websites professionally and was running into an issue implementing this plugin on my own. Once I got over my ego to ask for help from the developer (which is FREE by the way), the red carpet rolled out. I  was told they were backlogged and it might take a few days, and within an hour I got a notice it was done! Because of the theme I was using, I had a couple other issues (which I would have though was out of the scope of work) NO!!!!! They fixed that too. AMAZING! Bold has risen the bar for all of us in the industry. Thank you. I am anxious to use your other apps now as well.

Oh and on top of that..... The App ROCKS!"	1512
152	5	2015-11-27T00:00:00Z	"Rocchio Coffee has been around since 1876. My great-great grandfather roasted coffee for the village of Gallo Matese in central Italy. I learned to roast coffee from my grandfather, Pasquale Rocchio. As a small artisan roaster, people were buying my coffee on a regular basis - every few weeks or once or twice a month. It was always getting them online, put in credit card - such a hassle. But now, with Re-occuring charges - it's order once for continued delivery. Now I can concentrate on roasting the best coffee in America.

I'm a coffee roaster...I'm geek about coffee...not so much with setting up online shopping carts. The support team was fantastic getting me pointed in the right direction, setting everything up so all I had to do was add coffee!

It's the Easy Button."	1513
152	5	2015-11-27T00:00:00Z	Easy to use and offers our customers a great way to keep stocked up for dessert.  Right on Bold!	1514
152	5	2015-11-26T00:00:00Z	Absolutely thrilled with this app, so easy to install (well, Support installed it for me for free :) the app looks so good in my products now, very seamless and so easy to manage. Very excited to have it up and running now. Thanks guys! James	1515
152	4	2015-12-28T00:00:00Z	"I recently installed this app, and it's been very exciting for me thus far. They offer great support. Shoutout to Sarika for hooking the design up for me. It took 1 day to do the installation, even though they warned that it might have taken 3-4 days. The set up was fairly easy. I'm looking forward to trying other apps that they've developed.
Best experience so far with the support team was that they under promised, but over delivered.  My site was ready on time for my Holiday Campaigns. I really appreciated that."	1516
152	5	2015-11-25T00:00:00Z	The app was incredibly easy to install and works extremely well. The interface is very easy to use, and it really opened up a lot of product options for our store.	1517
152	5	2016-11-10T00:00:00Z	"This a great app and a decent service. I had Bold do the initial install. To keep a very long story short...we lost over 17 of our initial recurring orders because whoever set things up didn't do it correctly. They fixed the issue after there was a chance of recourse and it really sucked to lose our initial recurring customers. Bold creates good apps but they really need to step it up in the support department.

UPDATE

April 23, 2016: 

I've changed my rating for Bold's Recurring Orders app to 5 stars. Bold improved support and has released some fantastic updates since I left my initial review.

UPDATE

Nov 10, 2016:

BOLD has really stepped up to the plate. Their support is *FANTASTIC*! They respond really quickly and have assisted us quite a bit with advanced implementation. They keep updating the features and I'm really happy I selected their recurring order app for our store!"	1518
152	5	2015-11-23T00:00:00Z	Mohammad couldn't have been more helpful. Great service, great app - excellent company. Thanks for getting www.freshpatch.com.au up and running.	1519
152	5	2015-11-21T00:00:00Z	Recurring orders is a major revenue source for us. We have tried several and we had even moved shopping carts to be able to accommodate this but all the solutions we tried were clunky. This is the first reasonably priced recurring order application that just makes sense. It was easy enough to set up and has many positive attributes. I really like it and think it will be a valuable resource for us. The only thing I don't like is that it mirrors our cart so that we do have to do a few things that aren't totally seamless. But on the whole it's an A grade product with room to move to the unassailable king of the hill with some additional integration work. Nicely done, easy to use and mostly seamless.	1520
153	5	2015-11-21T00:00:00Z	Perfect and if used properly will be a real revenue booster!	1521
153	5	2015-11-18T00:00:00Z	Shoutout to bradley for the quick installation!	1522
153	5	2015-11-16T00:00:00Z	We were tired of the lies from Volusion regarding their recurring shipment features. When they showed zero interest in fixing these we found Bold Apps Recurring Shipments. The features that this app gives to our customers and us make it an indispensable part of our business.	1523
153	5	2015-11-13T00:00:00Z	Very simple and powerful tool to add recurring orders to your products. Love the simplicity and appreciated the BoldApps team doing the integration on my behalf.	1524
153	5	2015-11-28T00:00:00Z	I love this app because I give my customers the convenience of autoship delivery and it gives me my best shot at not missing orders or having to remind them to purchase. Love the residual income too!! ;) 5 stars!	1525
153	5	2015-11-06T00:00:00Z	Fantastic app, and wonderful customer service and support.	1526

153	5	2015-10-29T00:00:00Z	Thank you Blake for installing my app so quickly! I tried to do it myself but couldn't get it to work. SO thankful you could add it that fast for me really appreciate it :)!! I'm going to try the Social AutoPilot next!	1529

154	5	2015-10-15T00:00:00Z	"Wow! Bold is a stellar app provider in a world of some many options. We use more than one and can't get enough. With the strongest support team that strives to offer the highest level of customer service, we are more than pleased. 

This app has been highly successful in creating an edge to create returning fans of our company. Our site has a high traffic of new customers and we have seen drastic improvements on making a new customer a returning one! Simple to use with so many levels of customization, which we love, and capabilities to edit all our customers information if needed.

Any time we need assistance or have a request, Bold has been there for us 100% with our problems solved in one email! As a manager of customer experience and sales, it's an amazing relief to have answers quickly and resolutions provided in a short amount of time. Special shout-out to Brad and Kevin Wild, they have been a tremendous help and are always super friendly. 

We love Bold!"	1533
154	5	2015-10-12T00:00:00Z	As a subscription based brand, this solves everything I need.  It's also one of the most competitive priced apps on the market, which is great for a boostrapped company like ours. :)	1534
154	5	2015-10-12T00:00:00Z	As a business owner, we all know how much effort goes into attracting and converting just one customer.  Recurring orders enables us to not only capture that ever elusive first order, but further allows us to turn that initial order into repeat business, without having to send out endless marketing emails, etc...Simply convert the order and sit back and let the system do the rest app handle the rest.....I don't recommend running you Shopify store without it...	1535
154	5	2015-10-07T00:00:00Z	Best customer service on Shopify. Brad, answered all questions we had and they were a joy to deal with.	1536
154	5	2015-11-08T00:00:00Z	"Brenden Is the absolute man! He quickly got everything installed for me and was clear about how to use the app and where all the resources were to get the most out of it. I look forward to this tool helping us grow! As a luxury men's socks company this has been incredible for us! Allowing our customers the thrill of receiving randomly selected socks shipped to their door every month is amazing. It is extremely well integrated within shopify and is easy to manage........ And MAKE MONEY! Love this app and the customer service is amazing. Very reachable and extraordinarily helpful with the integration process.

I am by no means a programmer and Bold gets that! They helped me every step of the way setting up this streamlined process to revenue growth. They communicate effectively and efficiently we were up and running in no time!"	1537
154	5	2015-10-07T00:00:00Z	We implemented a loyalty program where existing customers would subscribe to our site, and receive free or reduced shipping on the products we sell daily. It helps build loyalty within our customer base, in a highly competitive market.	1538
154	5	2015-10-06T00:00:00Z	Easy setup! Mohammad did my liquid update soon after my request. Still in store setup phase but I don't have to a worry if this app will work or not.	1539
154	2	2016-04-03T00:00:00Z	"Really great concept but poorly executed. Any update of product inventory means that I get a notification that I have deleted products that are part of recurring orders. This means I have to re-add the same products to the app over and over again. The app also started adding 10% on to my orders for an unknown reason which I had to manually correct and refund credit cards etc. Support are responsive but the reply to having to re-add the same products every time I update the inventory was effectively ""that's just how it works"". I am actively looking for an alternative which is a shame as it could be a good app."	1540
155	5	2015-10-03T00:00:00Z	I think this is super easy not just to use but to set up. I do not have any type of experience abd I join shopify and became an expert. The developers made this super easy and a great dashboard to manage all subscriptions... Good Job guys	1541
155	5	2015-12-11T00:00:00Z	"The recurring app is fabulous and creates sales where they might never have been. In fact I filled an order today for a client that gets 3 units a month. Very cool. The order just shows up in my email and I ship it :)

Support has been great. Kevin responds quickly to help with any issue. I had a simple question and it was answered quickly

The recurring app is wonderful. The product I have on it is Sex Butter/Boudoir Butter, an organic vaginal lubrication-alternative. http://bonniesherbals.com/collections/organic-vaginal-moisturizer

People need to reorder each month, or every few months depending on what they personally need. It helps me know how many I will need and makes life easier for my clients and myself in knowing that the product will arrive when they need it and they don't need to remember to reorder. 

Just a big thank you on putting together the app and also for fixing the issue so that we can change the date, so that local taxes are taken out and we can adjust the amount etc of when the products should be shipped

Much appreciation

155	5	2015-10-02T00:00:00Z	"We started working on our company / brand around the beginning of this year. We've tried other subscription apps such as Charge Rabbit, but all-in-all , from experience of past businesses - we've realized how powerful Recurring orders really is. So we decided to get Recurring orders right off the bat to get our subscription based business going. [Sock Subscriptions - to be exact :] 

I believe membership / subscription based businesses are blooming in this era & I'd definitely like to get my start-up on the right foot and ahead of the game. At the moment, we've been paying for recurring orders; but have yet to truly utilize it due to the variety of projects we've been juggling & brainstorming [ which is almost all subscription-based ]. 

But all in all, I'm definitely looking forward to fully utilize and convert our store using Recurring orders as our backbone operations, as I've heard from my business partner that it is an extremely powerful subscription app that allows for ease of maintenance once the setup is complete.

I would definitely recommend Recurring orders for future subscription based Shopify stores, if they ever needed a referral for one. & I would definitely use Recurring orders for all our future subscription-based stores. Especially if our business is predicted to make enough to cover the monthly cost - it's definitely worth it to get started on the app right off the bat."	1543
155	5	2015-10-02T00:00:00Z	LOVE the support and help I got from this app/Bold. They are amazing and the set up was super simple. I would highly recommend this!	1544

I have been for 10 years now, and for 10 years the big challenge has always been how does little ol me, in a world where big player grocery stores have the people all trained to drive to one place and get everything they could possibly dream of, find the customers who still want to know where their food really comes from.  The problem is that it's inconvenient for them to drive to my farm in the middle of nowhere, so my first thought is that I'll make an online retail shop, take orders, and then I'll get the products to them, several customers at one time.  But the issue for them is that it's still not as convenient for them because they eat more than just meat, and they'd like to get other foods locally too.  So my idea becomes to source more local products from all my farmer friends, and I'll put it on my store and bring it to our customers too.  But EVERY farmer has a different weekly routine, and it becomes almost impossible to organize a communication routine to place our weekly customer orders to the various farmers--they all have different production schedules. This problem almost thwarted the business idea, because the small independent dairy farmer just needed more lead time when they were pouring the milk and making the yogurt!  Then I discovered Recurring Orders from BOLD!  This changed everything!  Now customers can just make a standing order for a set period of time, and we are able to give the dairy folks plenty of lead time!  Not only that, the customers can make standing orders for lots of their weekly food needs, and yet they still have the flexibility of making one-time orders any week they want for products we already have in inventory back at the farm.  So, we're able in a smaller scale than would ever be feasible to offer something as convenient as the old fashioned doorstep milk delivery, but without the scale needed to absorb order losses from order cancellations, and we can even bring all the other weekly groceries too!   Now this is a story of how appropriate technology can give back opportunity to small business, allowing the good things from the past to be new again.  Recurring Orders will be Re-generating our Nova Scotia economy, one happy locavore at a time!  Big greedy guys, we might take a little of your market!      

I don't have time to learn the liquid programming knowledge...not while there's cows to tend and fences to mend.  The opportunity for your teck-hand Mohammad to do it for me was MUCH appreciated!  Thanks man!  Your instructions were in delivered in perfect clarity and simplicity!  Just thanks!"	1546
155	2	2015-09-29T00:00:00Z	"Great idea, poor execution and support.

I've run into support issues with Bold Apps in the past. They are super aggressive with soliciting reviews so you end up with a skewed feedback when looking at their apps, which is why I'm taking the time to leave an honest review.

I had a customer contact me about a problem with the app. I had him give me all the specifics and he even took screenshots of the errors, which I submitted along with my ticket to Bold a couple of days ago.

In the meantime I lost a $200+ monthly subscription since the customer can't complete the order, and I haven't' heard a peep beyond the automated we'll get back to you email.

The app itself seems ok if they can get it working, but the support is not up to par. I have however, gotten at least 4 or 5 emails offering to get free or discounted apps in exchange for leaving a review. I don't think this was what they had in mind."	1547
155	5	2015-09-28T00:00:00Z	Great app, easy to use functionality and very user friendly.  Great appearance on website as well.  Makes accepting subscription orders seamless when checking out!	1548
155	5	2015-09-27T00:00:00Z	I can't believe it is free!  I guess that's just another great reason to be with Shopify.  Oops, but I'm writing on behalf of my partner and I who have been lucky enough to find a totally 100% (really) FREE Automated Recorriing Payments, and Recurring DONATIONS and Recurring Advertising APP from Bold.  We were researching and looking for almost three years and here we are with Bold Commerce and their whole slew of FREE Products (atleast for Shopify Web-Shop Clients) but I am very certain that anyone can get the 90 DAY FREE TRIALS they offer for all of their apps! Thanks Shopify and Thanks Bold Commerce!	1549
155	5	2020-03-04T00:00:00Z	Aryan Sharma helped us out quickly with a small technical question.  We've used this app for over 5 years now and are completely happy with the functionality and recurring revenue.	1550
156	5	2015-09-24T00:00:00Z	Everything seems to be working perfectly so far. The set up was hassle free, would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a subscription payment app.	1551
156	5	2015-09-23T00:00:00Z	Great app! Thanks Brenden for setting it up for me!	1552
156	5	2015-09-23T00:00:00Z	Yes, I would definitely recommend Recurring Orders. The app is great, easy to use, and the customer service is top notch! Brenden has been more than helpful with everything and quick as well! This kind of service is rare these days so thank you!	1553
156	5	2016-05-19T00:00:00Z	"The app is great! Well planned and executed...very user friendly with lots of functionality. My biggest concern was the ability for my customers to be able to log in to my page and control their subscription and this app allows this. It also looks great (I hate the Amazon radio button used on other apps).

Big thanks to Kevin for his technical help and Brenden for getting me started! High five!

Had some minor requests and Corey did a great job getting the changes taken care of. Great company from my experience so far."	1554
156	5	2015-09-17T00:00:00Z	"Bold you have done it AGAIN! Thank you for building this incredible app. The support team is lightning fast. Do yourself a favor and have them install the app so you can focus on selling. 
Thanks Graeme,You rock.

156	1	2015-09-16T00:00:00Z	"Even more disappointed and uninstalled.

We're writing this review having been a Bold apps user for nearly two years and having received good customer support until we met 'Recurring orders' Unfortunately the customer support we received was awful and its at times like this you get to know what a company is really like.

After 2.5 weeks and being told two time the app installation was all good we uninstalled the app.

The final nail in the coffin was the fact we could add a product to our cart and it showed the correct price, if you removed it and then added it again the app included it in your cart at a much lower randomly generated price!! quite an issue! We were advised by Kevin we would have to wait even longer for a fix and there may be some cache issue but it could be shopify or bold apps. We didnt even get an apology for the delay or an indication of how long it would take to be fixed, so we gave up.

After spending 30 minutes removing all the code we installed we then visited the app store and installed another subscription app, we didnt have two hours of copying and pasting code, just a press of the 'install' button and hey presto we were up and running. We even emailed their support team for a few custom tweaks and they were done instantly. Now thats what i call customer support!

The two experiences were at completely opposite ends of the spectrum. We will certainly be thinking twice about using any more Bold apps, which is a real shame.

ORIGINAL 1 STAR REVIEW :

Exceptionally disappointed.

We fired in a email to support as our theme code is a little different to the instructions, having installed 95% of the code. We requested a call with Kevin who looked at the issue and advised it would be fixed by 31st August at the latest. Sadly the fix didnt arrive.

After several emails over the last week and 1.5 hours on chat to Bold last night we got an email overnight saying the issue (subtotal showing zero on cart page) was all fixed and we were good to to. Excitedly we turned our test product subscription back on to find it still isnt fixed, so ive sent in yet another email. 

We are now two weeks into our trial period and still cant use the app.

We purchased our first Bold app about a year ago and have been coming back as the support at that time was fantastic, like the apps we have already. However in recent months it has been very poor and questions and issues have taken a long time to get fixed."	1557
156	5	2015-09-15T00:00:00Z	Graeme was awesome! He completed my liquid install in record time. :)	1558
156	5	2015-09-14T00:00:00Z	"Free installation was a nice bonus! Just started to setup the app and so far so good! Lots of customization. 

Brenden set it up for me. It was done in 3 business days."	1559
156	5	2015-09-14T00:00:00Z	"As always a great app from the team at Bold. Installed it and had them do the code install which they did within 48 hours.
The amount of options and setting you can change is amazing. It does everything we need it to and have had a few people sign up for our Coffee Subscription using this app without a flaw. With 90 days free trial it was a no brainer to give it a try."	1560
157	5	2015-09-13T00:00:00Z	Great app! I tried several (which is a pain to setup and then uninstall) and can say that this one was the best for me. Even better is the great customer support they offer! Thanks Bold :)	1561
157	4	2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	"We have been using Recurring orders for our green coffee subscriptions at www.RoastCoffeeAndTeaCompany.com Our customers like the ease of use and it helps us grow recurring sales.

157	5	2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	Works great and the support has been awesome!	1563
157	5	2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	I love this app. It is a great way to add a subscription to our page.	1564
157	5	2015-09-10T00:00:00Z	Thanks Brenden for getting my app installed!	1565
157	1	2015-09-06T00:00:00Z	This used to be a great company as far as support. They installed this, claimed it was 100% and even set to my style... Obviously not, and anyone could have seen that by just looking at the page. Request after request, canned response after canned response. I will NOT be recommending these guys any longer, I am embarrassed that I ever did!	1566
157	5	2015-09-03T00:00:00Z	Amazing support and love the app! Shoutout to Tamer and Brenden for their awesome work and service	1567
157	5	2015-09-02T00:00:00Z	"Great extension, nice work and awesome service.
Brenden is da maaaaan!"	1568
157	5	2015-08-31T00:00:00Z	Great app and amazing support!	1569
157	5	2015-08-26T00:00:00Z	"Originally, I reviewed a 1 star.  This was due to the challenge I had with getting in contact with any team member.  However, I was reached out to be a few team members and was given excellent service.  They dedicated time with me on the phone, helped me brainstorm ideas for buildout, and installed the app for me.  

Truly an awesome team there and they are working really hard for each customer it seems.  I have just started tinkering with the app and it's fantastic!  Lots of control, functionality, and one of the best UX/UI available.  The wait was well worth it."	1570
158	5	2015-08-24T00:00:00Z	Top Service installed within 1 day, even went to the lengths of matching the style to my store too! Marie-Claude may you win your office competition! You deserve it!	1571
158	5	2015-08-21T00:00:00Z	They take car of the installation of the liquid code! Marty is great.	1572
158	5	2015-08-20T00:00:00Z	Bold has done it again. This app is great. Easy to use. All the features we needed and great, great customer support. They are on it!	1573
158	5	2015-11-29T00:00:00Z	"I've had two experiences with your support team - both equally timely and efficient. One of the products we KNOW moms use everyday are diapers and wipes. We wanted to provide a diaper and wipes auto shipment product and make it available to our Mommy Market Members. This is a recurring product - hence the need for Bold Apps Recurring Orders App. Initially I attempted to install the App myself. I got to a certain point and no longer felt comfortable. I then took advantage of the Bold Apps offer to install the application for me. Thank you for that! The support team quickly installed the app for me and even styled it to match our site as best they could. This product has over 100 variables. After some testing, I was not able to get the product to work correctly and pull in the product price information for the variable that the user chose. After reaching out to the Bold Apps support team, I received timely communication and they fixed the issue for me - even with so many different variables.

I've been in business for 12 years now and customer service is very important to me. It is not often I find an organization that provides the level of service that I offer and expect. Bold Apps has definitely delivered in this area!"	1574
158	5	2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	Fantastic App!!! Highly recommend to those wanting to easily integrate recurring orders. Powerful, flexible features and few limitations. Five Stars! Thank you!	1575
158	5	2015-08-13T00:00:00Z	Very impressed with both the functionality of this app and the extraordinary customer service. We had an informative initial call with Kevin when we installed the app, and whenever I've had questions he's incredibly responsive and helpful. Can't recommend this app more. Do you yourself the favor.	1576
158	5	2015-08-12T00:00:00Z	Very helpful, friendly team, so excited about trying the app.. Just need to wait a bit till they install the app on my website :)	1577
158	4	2015-08-11T00:00:00Z	You guys have a really nice app with lots of options that make it easy for the shop owner and their customers. I really appreciate the help and support from your customer support team. Especially Kevin and Matthew who have helped with some of the questions that I have had about the app. Thanks again for the app.	1578
158	5	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	Great app with great service. Blake is awesome!	1579
158	4	2015-08-05T00:00:00Z	"Excellent customer service, I've been pleased by how prompt they are in answering my questions. If I haven't heard from one customer service rep I've been chatting with for a while (who was apparently on vacation at the time), I can ping the ""support@"" for an immediate reply back by another customer service rep for help. 

Only 4 stars and not 5 because no Mailchimp integration yet, which is important to me."	1580
159	4	2015-08-03T00:00:00Z	"This App is easy to setup and works well.  The service provided from Kevin has also been very good!  

I can highly recommend to anyone looking to take recurring payments."	1581
159	4	2015-07-30T00:00:00Z	"We're a subscription box company for sports nutrition products, and we need the ability to sell subscriptions in order for our business to work. Recurring Orders therefore forms the very core of our online presence. 

We initially had some issues with setup, but the guys at Bold are very helpful, and we're now happy customers!"	1582
159	5	2015-07-27T00:00:00Z	Bold staff, Brenden, installed the app for us beautifully! Love it! Thank you Brenden.	1583
159	5	2015-07-26T00:00:00Z	"i sell my poems printed over differents support. I launched the store las 23th of may and just begin now. Im started up business, And i have to learn a lot of things about on line marketing.

Always i have a dubt you explain me really faster my questions"	1584
159	5	2015-07-22T00:00:00Z	"Hey guys,
thanks for the formidable support, especially to Marty, who implemented the liquid for my shop page."	1585
159	5	2015-07-21T00:00:00Z	"Thanks to Brenden, I'm now up and running. 
I can't wait for my customers to start using this app! I've been looking for something like this for a while. 
Brenden was very helpful and so was Kevin as well.
Thanks guys!"	1586
159	5	2015-07-19T00:00:00Z	Awesome app! Love it and it works great!	1587
159	4	2015-07-08T00:00:00Z	"This installation is a work in progress.  I will continue to update as we move forward.

Installation was a breeze.  Kevin was super supportive and eager/willing to help.  That is why they get a star.  They had 5 stars until our launch.  

Once we launched and people wanted to make changes to their accounts, that's when they lost 4 stars.  They would have lost 5 if Shopify would have allowed it.  There seems to be no sense of urgency to help us help our customers and that is a shame.  The issues are that customers either 1) can't log in and are told there is no account with their email address or 2) they can get in but it says they have no active subscription to cancel or change.  Both are super basic features that we were told this app had.  If the team made me feel that they cared and were working hard to help get it fixed, I would feel a little better.  Unfortunately, the jury is still out. 
....................................
UPDATE:  After finally getting in touch with someone (in a matter of hours once I, the owner, got involved) we were able to work together to figure out that if a customer does not set up an account when they make the purchase, they cannot manage their account (sounds obvious now but in the order process, you don't realize that you are not setting up an account).  In lieu of forcing registration and potentially losing sales, we will send out an email reminding customers to sign up on our site using the same email address they did for their subscription and then the management portion is super easy and self explanatory.  If anyone else is doing this a different way with success, please let me know.

Speed bumps hurt but the goal is that you get past them and learn from them. I can say that once the right people heard my concerns, they were right on it - even one person from vacation and one from home."	1588
159	5	2015-07-05T00:00:00Z	Graeme from Bold Apps is the JAM!!  White Glove treatment in getting the Recurring Orders app integrated into my store!	1589
159	5	2015-06-30T00:00:00Z	"So far so good! Works really well and easy to set up!  Does what its suppose to do and updates almost instantly to products on the site! Although I love it there are some features I would like to add but I will keep this review positive as they have done everything they promised!  We got a quick and easy install of the Liquid on the Product Page thanks to Graeme!  We really appreciate your help here at Outcast Garage!  We use a lot of Bold Apps and love them all!!!  We definitely recommend that you use this if you have products on a subscription basis.  We use this for our VIP Memberships and soon we will convert all the customers to this to create residual income off of these memberships!

Thank you again!

Chris and the Outcast Garage Staff"	1590
160	5	2015-06-24T00:00:00Z	"We have been avid BOLD Apps users since they started. They simply make our life easier...

You see... we sell baby products. In fact, we are THE one stop shop for baby products in Mexico. Our customers have been waiting for a subscription model in order to forget about buying diapers and spend more time with their baby. 

Family time and quality time with our loved ones has always been very important. However, with work and our social commitments we usually find it very difficult to squeeze some extra time. Luckily, BOLD has just made this easier for parents! 

The Recurring Orders App will definitely save time to parents and allow them to spend more time with their loved ones. Additionally it will save us time and help us predict our inventory better.

There is nothing better for us than to make a customer´s life easier....and BOLD has done it for us."	1591
160	5	2015-06-23T00:00:00Z	"Absolutely phenomenal service! I was able to ask lots of questions and have as much help as I needed to install it, the whole team were helpful at every step! 

To make life lots easier a team member can actually telephone you and take you through the installation, making it so easy! 

This has been the best app I've ever installed! FAB FAB FAB! :))"	1592
160	5	2015-06-18T00:00:00Z	Installation was easily and Bold took care of the setup for us. Definitely has all of the capabilities we were looking for and more!	1593
160	5	2015-06-16T00:00:00Z	"Just got the app installed and really happy with how easy it was to setup. 
I'm not a programmer but can get by with code - unfortunately couldn't do it all by myself, but wasn't an issue at all as Graeme from Bold was amazing in setting it up - even going the extra mile to ""adapt"" to my current theme.
Will be looking to customize more and feel confident I can trust Bold due to the confidence Graeme built in the installation process."	1594
160	5	2015-06-16T00:00:00Z	"Five star reviews are given out way to often, but I genuinely 
*Amazing  service from Kevin and Graeme. I'd hire these guys away from Bold in a second.
*The product works well, which is a basic thing but the most important
*It intergrates flawlessly with my store and theme

Well worth the money to do subscriptions."	1595
160	5	2015-06-16T00:00:00Z	I love this app. It does exactly what you need it to do. It looks great and is very intuitive and easy to tweak to your requirements. Graeme, one of the Bold Support Wizards, not only took care of the instillation for us, but also took time to answer any questions in a way that even I could understand. The app and customer care really is second to non. I highly recommend this app and Bold in general.	1596
160	5	2015-06-15T00:00:00Z	Graeme is the best! Took only a few hours to get this installed.  Set it up perfectly.  Would recommend this to anyone who needs to set up subscription payments!	1597
160	5	2016-09-19T00:00:00Z	Bold Apps customer service is great! I've called and emailed a couple times with small questions that are unique to our website and product and they were handled in a timely manner and with utmost professionalism.	1598
160	5	2015-06-11T00:00:00Z	"Super Cool App.  Max Max Max....You Give Great Customer Service!!  Seriously.  All you have to do is email Max and he's on it.  So awesome.  Now my recurring app works with my theme and it looks cool too.  Thank you Max at Bold Apps.  I really appreciate your taking the time, making it happen and helping me with this.  It means a great deal to me as a business owner and makes me feel like I'm not totally lost in this technical wonderland that is ""apps"" that I don't understand.  Nicole, Radiance SkinCare"	1599
160	5	2015-06-08T00:00:00Z	Although we're just getting started with the recurring order app, so far we've very pleased.  The support provided by Kevin at Bold Apps has been outstanding and it makes a huge difference.  Thank you!	1600
161	5	2016-01-01T00:00:00Z	"We are very impressed!  The bold team has gone above and beyond to help us get up and running with Recurring Orders.   Thank you Kevin, Marty and Brenden for all your help.  

Update:  We have been using Recurring Orders for the past 6 months and it has been a blessing.  A fantastic addition for any store that sells subscriptions."	1601
161	5	2015-06-05T00:00:00Z	"Great app, well supported by helpful staff quick to respond to queries (Kevin has been superb)

highly recommend it."	1602
161	5	2015-06-04T00:00:00Z	Graeme completed my liquid installation and sent a link to a YouTube video to help me get set up...which I found very easy to do.  I'm looking forward to using this App to build my business!	1603
161	5	2015-05-29T00:00:00Z	"The recurring orders app has made us future proof. We have new programs we'd like to implement, and how to handle the orders was always the biggest challenge. We're ready for some big changes!
I've contacted the support team several times. Usually it's due to a minor glitch in the app. Although the glitches may not always be 100% resolved, a work around was always provided.  Now our website, www.simplycountry.net. can not only provide the initial setup equipment, but additional support items as we make them available."	1604
161	5	2015-05-26T00:00:00Z	"It's so weird that recurring orders isn't an easy thing to find for your store! If you do find it, it's usually too complicated for customers to adjust their subscription settings. This is why I really love the Bold Recurring Orders app. It's made with the customer in mind, so I don't have to take time out of my day explaining how to subscribe to my coaching products. It saves me time, stress, and puts a load off on my customers that they don't feel like they've been trapped in a commitment they can't get out of.

The support team is the most responsive team I've met. I worried that I would have to wait several days for my app to be up and running, but no! Within the hour everything is coded and ready for my store. I feel like this is an actual team of people, and not just an algorithm with automatic responses. That is what makes the Bold team so special to me and my store.

You guys are awesome. When I become a programming genius, I would love to work alongside your team :)"	1605
161	5	2015-05-26T00:00:00Z	"The app is working great thanks to some IT help from Kevin.  He was very helpful and nice!

The getting started video helped too but is a little long. Would be nice to have one for setting up the app then one for using it to make it easier to navigate."	1606
161	5	2015-05-20T00:00:00Z	So far so good! The guys who helped me were both GREAT! The app works wonders as well. Thanks, Scott & Kevin!! :)	1607
161	5	2015-05-20T00:00:00Z	"The Recurring Orders app from Bold Apps has literally transformed our business.

We've been successfully selling coffee and tea online for years, but have never been able to set up a reliable and affordable subscription service, even though our customers were crying out for it! When Bold launched Recurring Orders, we jumped right in having used a number of other Bold apps before, and knowing how their support is pretty much unparalleled in the industry. The installation was straightforward, and within minutes (not even hours) the nuts and bolts of our new subscription business were in place. A couple of days building our catalogue and tweaking our store design and we were in business. We've grown from a site with a small base of loyal customers, to a behemoth in the world of subscriptions in no time! Our fulfilment team are having to find a bigger warehouse to keep shipping all the orders we're sending; but the beauty of it is that they don't even need to touch the app - it integrates so well with Shopify that the orders just come through like any other one-off order, and they just process them as such - perfect.

Our customers love the integration with their account, and the flexibility the system gives them to manage all aspects of their subscription (and our customer service team love the fact that life is a lot quieter for them with a great self-serve approach for our customers!) We've needed to reach our to Bold's support team for advice on a couple of things, and each time they've been incredibly quick to respond and send us in the right direction. Like all of their other apps, Bold's team fully understand their products, and take complete ownership of any questions or issues we encounter. As you've probably guessed, I would happily recommend Bold Recurring Orders to anyone with a Shopify store; even if your core business isn't repeat order focussed, the simple addition to your store's back end and the low monthly cost makes it a bit of a no-brainer, and a great proposition for your customers.

During the beta stage of the app, there were a few areas of the integration that weren't quite working with our theme. Bold's support team offered some great technical assistance with some Liquid coding errors on our site - absolutely nothing to do with the Recurring Orders app, and yet they offered free support without question. That's the kind of above-and-beyond support that'll keep us using the app indefinitely!

The developer universe can be a bit hit and miss when it comes to support, but once again Bold have shown what a truly professional team they are, who thoroughly believe in their products and will stand by their apps when assistance is required. Moving to Shopify's platform was the best thing we ever did for our business; installing Recurring Orders was a very close second!"	1608
161	5	2015-05-19T00:00:00Z	Excellent app, Bold installed it for me and has been working great, Support was quick to solve any issues i had.   My automatic re- orders has gone off flawless. Thanks Bold	1609
161	5	2015-05-15T00:00:00Z	Easy to get started (thanks to a quick liquid install by Brenden). Can't wait to share with our customers!	1610
162	5	2015-05-14T00:00:00Z	"Haven't started using the app yet, but support during set up is 5*
Have been speaking to Kevin, very quick to reply and super helpful!"	1611
162	5	2015-05-20T00:00:00Z	"My interactions with Kevin and Max have been stellar. Max is a true ""Bold Support Wizard"". It's clear that you have real support people (with actual brain mass) working at Bold that actually read their emails. Max offered to provide me with an extra month and I told him that would be ""awesome possum"". He responded with, ""And here I thought I was the only person who said ""awesome possum!"" :-) So... thanks for providing real humans to support your customers so we can focus on other aspects of our business."	1612
162	5	2015-05-13T00:00:00Z	"I moved to shopify after using a wordpress site and was looking for a efficient recurring order app--- your recurring order app fit the bill; which is pretty awesome.  I have many resources and tools I could have used, but I chose to stick with you guys.

From installation, integrating it with my current products, and managing the orders; it has been a breeze. Being able to use coupon codes and give the customers a discount for subscribing is a fantastic touch.  

Thanks for being so awesome!"	1613
162	3	2015-05-21T00:00:00Z	"THIS APP DID NOT WORK FOR US - UNDERSTAND ITS LIMITATIONS BEFORE INSTALLING.

I've upgraded my 1-star review after finally talking to the developer. 

Know that after the initial order, every recurring order will default to select the cheapest available shipping method, regardless of which shipping method the customer chose.  For us this was a mess -- it was creating orders for local pickup 2 states away from where the customer lives, because that method happened to be free.

The app looks great and they said they're working to resolve the issue, but unfortunately we can't wait -- we've lost long-time customers over the mixups. We have to go back to ReCharge -- it has less features but their Customer Support was fast and excellent.  I do believe Bold Apps will ultimately get this issue resolved, but ask them first if you have concerns."	1614
162	5	2015-05-05T00:00:00Z	"I have several businesses and am now starting an e-commerce store with no experience in programming or site set up. Recurring Apps is an easy to use and understand app which is critical to my subscription business. 

Kevin Wild, the best Tech support ever, has been a life saver through this start-up process. He has helped me with so many backend pieces that I have no expertise handling. Kevin is not only knowledgeable but he is efficient and very quick to respond to whatever I was needing help with."	1615
162	1	2019-07-01T00:00:00Z	I depend on this app for $400k a year of business. They charge a monthly fee plus a percentage of sales. Their support is painfully slow, they fail to copy Shopify support on their replies, and their half-thought out answers are poor at best. I really want to love Bold Apps, I do. But your support is shallow and fails to even begin to look at the entirety of a ticket and replies with a Tier one level response. You are the sole reason I'm moving my business away from Shopify. Love Shopify, you guys, not at all.	1616
162	5	2015-05-01T00:00:00Z	When I needed some details further explained, my main ninja Kevin was there and provided me with top notch solutions. He called exactly when he said he would, he answered every question I had, and rather than redirecting me to someone else when I needed some code altered, he took care of it himself.  Like I said, top notch. If the rest of the Bold staff is like Kevin, they too will end up getting acquired for 900 million like BrainTree did.	1617
162	5	2015-04-28T00:00:00Z	I can't recommend highly enough both this amazing app and the guys at Bold. They're truly amazing. I've been lucky enough to have their immediate help to solve any issue I was finding along the way, working side by side for as long as I needed. Now the app is up an running and looking very good indeed! Oh, and the app couldn't be more user-friendly. TOP!	1618
162	5	2015-05-19T00:00:00Z	"First, I don't know where to start. The ease and automatic nature of the reoccurring order app is borderline ridiculous for a novice like me. Second, this app has literally been 100% successful in capturing EVERY order from customers who put into their checkout. The best part, is each order is not a one and done order, the customer is now reordering each month until whenever! Our monthly income is growing and becoming more consistent.

The support team had received almost daily calls for the first week of questions and ""if they could do that"" type stuff. Every time they were very courteous, polite, friendly and solved all my thoughts. They even went above and beyond to code in something that had even been done yet. But, listened to my suggestion, tried many times and finally made it happen! Just to make me a happy customer."	1619
162	1	2015-04-20T00:00:00Z	"Sorry to say that we are very unimpressed here. Developers say that we can't use the app because we have some unusual third-party shipping solution. Eh what? If using UPS, USPS and Fedex shipping rate calculators is unusual, then I guess we can exclude a big chunk of shopify stores from this app right away. Combine that with the inability to go through checkout with a discount, which is also very standard. 

We spent a lot of time integrating this app only to find out that simple checkout stuff does not work. The reply from Kevin at support was in essence that there's nothing to do about it. Boldapps put out a lot of great apps and we use several of them, but this one was pushed out too soon. 

Think twice about this app  unless perhaps you enter shipping rates manually or have flat shipping rates for your products."	1620
163	5	2015-04-17T00:00:00Z	"Another home run app from the team at Bold Apps. 
I've really enjoyed every app I have installed with them. They have been super helpful with any questions I ever have. 
Recurring Orders app integrates really well with my store and I'm excited about the potential with this app. For sure a must download if you can offer recurring orders on your store. 

Thank You Guys!"	1621
163	4	2015-04-17T00:00:00Z	"Max was the ""Wizard"" who installed the app for me and he completed this task in less than the 2 business days that was quoted. I was very happy that this service was offered, as I am not a coder. It really helped get the app going on my website. When I needed something tweaked, another representative completed the task less than two hours after I sent the request email. So far, I am happy with my experience with this app. 

My one complaint is specific to my store's theme. I am not happy with how the login information appears in my header, and according to the second representative I spoke to, this cannot be changed without altering the coding of the theme. So - it is nothing against the actual app. Just be warned that the final appearance in your store may not be similar to the example coffee website that Bold uses to showcase this app."	1622
163	4	2015-04-04T00:00:00Z	App has great functionality and the support team is very helpful. Unfortunately, Stripe is not supported in Malaysia yet and recurring functions are limited for PayPal.	1623
163	4	2015-04-01T00:00:00Z	Still some tweaking to do but its looking good so far. Very helpful set up from the Bolapps team. Videos are very clear. Just got to get our customers to fall in love now! We're still in Beta but it's definitely worth a trial if this is something you think might be useful to you.	1624
163	5	2015-05-19T00:00:00Z	"Bold’s Saves Lives! 

Crazy Critters specializes in Sugar Gliders & Hedgehogs (sweet and cuddly as well as prickly exotic pets that we have worked with for many years) and being a licensed USDA professional dealer we spend a lot of time with our customers teaching about the importance of food / diet choices and how this impacts their pets long term health. Time and time again we have seen exotic animals get sick and die from substandard ""box store"" foods and it always makes us so very sad so we started marketing the only high end food available that actually meets these exotic pets needs. But the problem was your average pet parent gets busy and often forgets that they need to order more ""Wild Glider"" exotic foods until it's to late! Then they call us frantic for answers about what to do or even worse they substitute one of those poor quality ""box store"" foods or let their little babies go without! We wanted to find an application that could help us help our customers and their pets by making the ordering process simple, fast, and easy! After looking for sometime we picked Bold's auto Recurring Ordering app and our customers love it because now they no longer have to worry or stress about getting food that their exotic pets need and love as now it comes every month like clockwork. We may never know for sure how many exotic pets have been saved by Bold’s app but we are sure it has helped make life more enjoyable and stress free for our customers while improving our financial bottom line. THANKS"	1625
163	1	2015-03-05T00:00:00Z	Really poor worst experience. Staff initially took 3 or 4 weeks back and forth as they would not test anything then the founder contacted me and they offered to assist again. Another 4 weeks on and still not functioning and customers complaining. Now they will not reply and assist in removing the app and changes they have made. The app is full of bugs and does not work with Mobilia Theme. This is a real shame because the concept of the app is good, sadly too many bugs at this stage.	1626
163	5	2015-03-03T00:00:00Z	"A very easy app to configure and use.
If you are looking for a simple to use but flexible solution to your recurrent billing needs - this is your app."	1627
163	5	2016-02-19T00:00:00Z	"Very good technology.  Great development.  Support is great and they really care.

A mission critical app for us!  Love it.  The new reporting features are a great start.

****
Had a major issue (something I did) and Corey was right there to help!"	1628
163	1	2015-02-26T00:00:00Z	"Here's my experience: I am a new company just starting up with Shopify and looking for the best apps to please my customers. I read the features for this app and was really excited. After everything was installed I had multiple issues/glitches. I was ok with this as it's in Beta. 

Here's what I wasn't ok with, multiple customers on my side were having issues with the service. When I passed up the issues, I wasn't getting a response. I threatened a bad review after 7 days of no response and suddenly had 3 different people responding. 

As a new retailer, it's important for me to provide superior customer service to my awesome customers. The apps I choose have to have a strong customer service and support team as well, to make sure that I can get back to my customers and resolve issues. It wasn't my experience with this app. 

I removed this app and went with someone else before my subscription service gets too big. The new company has amazing customer service and I've spent a total of 1 hour on the phone with them while they integrated my system 12 hours after moving to the app.

I'm very reluctant to write bad reviews, but I think it's important that I share my experience because I wish I had read all the reviews (I didn't read the bad ones) or I would have made a more educated choice."	1629
163	5	2015-05-21T00:00:00Z	Excellent app, Bold installed it for me and has been working great, Support was quick to solve any issues i had. My automatic re- orders has gone off flawless. Thanks Bold	1630
164	5	2015-02-16T00:00:00Z	Great app! The Bold team has been very helpful and responsive to my questions	1631
164	5	2015-02-15T00:00:00Z	"So far so good! I've been dying to drop Chargify for a more integrated solution that meshes with my non-recurring products. Brenden was awesome installing the liquid code for me and Holly has been very helpful. 

A few key features that I'd love to see but the app is still fairly new and they seem pretty open to adding requested features. This definitely seems like the long term solution though."	1632
164	5	2015-02-11T00:00:00Z	Have to test it in depth yet, but so far the experience has been phenomenal! Customer support couldn't be better: they answer your emails within minutes and one of their wizards has installed all the liquid code for free! Thank you for that Brenden! This app rocks!	1633
164	1	2015-02-10T00:00:00Z	Very disappointing app - many issues with this app - not fully integrating, recurring settings not working, customers not billed correctly, pricing of products wrong - we have been left with many orders for recurring orders which we cannot process or fulfill - the developers have not replied to any of our messages nor fixed any of the problems we have had with this app - we asked them to fix it or we will have to remove it from our shop and they removed it for us without even letting us know! Avoid at all costs unless you want loads of messed up orders and total chaos with your customers!!!!	1634
164	4	2015-02-09T00:00:00Z	"Where to start? Well, installation was a breeze - it only took a few minutes to get the app up and running. Then Shazam! Re-loaded a product page and there was the subscription option complete with my ""10% the purchase price today"" incentive. We are giving the App a 30 day test before signing up for the premium but so far so good. I will write another review at the end of the 30 days, letting everyone know how the subscriptions performed."	1635
164	5	2015-02-03T00:00:00Z	So far I love this app. They have excellent customer service and installation was easy.	1636
164	5	2015-02-02T00:00:00Z	After spending two months trying to use confusing API recurring payment documentation and misrepresented claims from another major player  this app does exactly what I want.  It assumes the burden of credit card processing rules and the complexity of recurring payments.  Blake has been an exceptional resource.	1637
164	5	2015-02-02T00:00:00Z	Love your product and Marty is being very helpful :D	1638
164	5	2015-02-02T00:00:00Z	It is hard enough running the basics of a business, let alone keeping up with all the technology advances.  With boldapps and their staff however...they go above and beyond standing by you and supporting to make a win win success.  That is exactly what was done for us here at Tipcupland and we can see the difference!!!	1639
164	5	2015-01-31T00:00:00Z	What sets this recurring payments app apart from others is that the recurrence becomes a feature of any product you choose. This is ideal for us as we sell consumable products (moustache wax and beard oil) that are used at different speeds by different people. As always, customer service from Bold is fantastic.	1640
165	5	2015-01-31T00:00:00Z	"I had been thinking about how to implement a subscription feature on my Shopify store, when I got the email announcing Bold Apps' Recurring Orders App.
I downloaded the App and selected the Option for Bold Apps to install the App on my Store for me. The Bold Recurring Orders App is the answer to my dream and greatly appreciate their off to install the App if I so desired.
Bold Support Wizard Scott, worked on my installation request and got it done perfectly and sent me an email to let men know that the App had been installed and was active on my store, and the best part - the installation was done for FREE! 

I am now about to promote my new store with the Recurring Orders App already installed from the start. This is fantastic, thanks to Bold Apps for releasing this great App at the right time for me, and thanks to Scott for installing it on my store!"	1641
165	5	2015-01-30T00:00:00Z	"Once again, Bold has stolen the show.  I have two Shopify stores with multiple Bold apps in each.  I've installed other recurring payment apps in the past and they didn't work.  When I would contact customer support, they would basically tell me that my products weren't what they built it for and that I was out of luck.

Now enter Bold...when I saw that they had launched their Recurring Payments app, I had to get it.  I've had nothing but good luck with their apps in the past.  After installation, there were some compatibility issues between this app and another app in my store.  The crew at Bold (Jay, Brenden, Ron, Michael, Travis) were in constant contact with me while we worked the issue until it was figured out.  Now everything is running just like I want it to.

I can't say enough good things about Bold.  Keep the great apps coming!"	1642
165	5	2015-01-27T00:00:00Z	Awesome product, awesome people, awesome support. Highly recommended. Thanks team Bold!	1643
165	5	2015-01-23T00:00:00Z	"First off, I do not write many reviews. It takes a special experience, either good or bad, for me to take my time to write a review.

This is one of those (very) good experiences.

The bold app support team is worthy of the cost of the app alone. hands down.

I have tried various subscription based apps, and when bold put out this new app, you bet I was going to try it. The installation process was like most other bold apps ( I have a few on my site) and requires a bit of coding knowledge. Or you can have their support team assist. Once installed, you are able to modify the look,feel, and placement of this subscription widget. In addition, customers are able to manage their subscriptions all within their same store account. (if you activated store accounts). No extra logins, BIg plus.

Now here, I did experience some concerns. My integration wasn't as smooth as I had hoped. The app ran into a few glitches in regards to the product page integration and checkout process.

The bold support team, with special shout-out to Curtis. was more than happy to help. It took a couple days to fully integrate this app within my website. Currently, there are known bugs, which i was told is on high priority and should be resolved early next week. My praise goes to the support team and their efforts. This feature to allow subscription-based ordering is an essential part of my business. Given this necessity, I am extremely picky when it comes to these type of apps. I believe I have finally chosen my app for this feature. Congrats bold team.
